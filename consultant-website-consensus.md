## Universal Core Principles

### The 10-Second Rule
**Consensus Finding**: Every source emphasizes immediate relevancy within 5-10 seconds
- TSA Von Neal: "10 seconds to establish relevancy"
- Consulting Success: "5-second relevancy test"
- Wix: "Answer basic visitor questions immediately"

**Recommended Implementation**: Hero section must instantly communicate:
1. Who you help (specific audience)
2. What problem you solve
3. What makes you different

### The Magnetic Message Formula
**Consensus Pattern**: All sources recommend a clear, benefit-focused value proposition
- TSA Von Neal's Formula: "I help {audience} achieve {benefit}. Unlike competitors, {differentiation}"
- Consulting Success: "Make it about them, not you"
- Squarespace: "Get straight to the point on value proposition"

**Best Practice**: Lead with client outcomes, not your credentials
