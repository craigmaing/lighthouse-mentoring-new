### Source 1: Consulting Success - Services Page Strategy

**Core Purpose of Services Pages**

The Services page is your "Solutions Expert" - it matches prospects with perfect solutions by focusing on problems solved and outcomes delivered, not just listing what you do.

#### Essential Elements for Services Pages

1. **Problem-First Approach**
   - Lead with client challenges, not your services

   - Address specific pain points before introducing solutions
   - Use their language to describe their problems

2. **Outcome-Based Service Descriptions**
   - Focus on transformation and results
   - "Streamline 5 Key Operational Processes to Save Time and Cut Costs"
   - Quantify benefits where possible (percentages, timeframes, metrics)
   - Paint picture of success after engagement

3. **Service Packaging Structure**
   - Present services as solutions to specific problems
   - Use productized service offerings when possible
