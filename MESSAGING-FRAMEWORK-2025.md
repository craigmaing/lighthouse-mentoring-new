---

### Option 3: Differentiation-Led (Unique Methodology Focus)

### WHY CRAIG SECTION

**Headline:** "Experience that can't be Googled"

**Subheadline:** "Most strategic advisors have qualifications. Some have experience. Very few have both at this level."

**Column 1: The Experience**
"17 years at board level across sectors including healthcare, technology, and professional services. Not as an observer—as the person making the calls. The person navigating stakeholder conflict. The person accountable when strategy meets reality.

You don't learn board dynamics from a textbook. You learn them from doing the work, making the mistakes, and earning the wisdom that comes from responsibility."

**Column 2: The Credentials**
"Craig holds three globally-recognized Fellowships—a combination that doesn't exist elsewhere:

- **IoD Ambassador** – Recognized authority on board governance and director effectiveness
- **FRSPH Fellow** – Leadership in public health, wellbeing strategy, and organizational culture
- **FCMI Fellow** – Mastery of management practice and organizational leadership

This isn't credential-collecting. It's proof of depth in three areas that matter for strategic advisory: governance expertise, wellbeing insight, and management mastery."

**Column 3: The Approach**
"No generic frameworks. No one-size-fits-all solutions. No theoretical consulting that looks good on slides but fails in practice.

Every engagement starts with your context, your constraints, your reality. The advice you get is shaped by evidence, informed by experience, and designed for your specific situation.

Strategic clarity. Practical wisdom. Measurable results."

**CTA:** "See If We're a Fit"

**Body Copy:**
"No pressure. No sales pitch. Just a strategic conversation about your challenge.

Most clients start with a 45-minute exploratory call to discuss what they're navigating and whether Craig's experience and approach are the right fit. If they are, we design an engagement around your specific needs. If not, you'll still walk away with clarity.

Book a time that works for you, or send a message describing your situation."

### SERVICE PAGE 1: Board Advisory & Governance

**Hero:**
**H1:** "Board Advisory & Governance"
**Subheadline:** "Strategic clarity for directors navigating complex governance, stakeholder dynamics, and high-stakes board decisions."
**CTA:** "Discuss Your Board Challenge"

---

**The Challenge:**

Board-level decisions are different. The stakes are higher. The dynamics are more complex. The accountability is personal.

You're navigating shareholder expectations, regulatory requirements, executive relationships, and strategic uncertainty—often simultaneously. A misstep isn't just a business error; it's a governance failure with legal, reputational, and financial consequences.

Traditional consulting rarely helps because consultants haven't sat where you sit. They haven't felt the weight of fiduciary duty. They haven't had to make the call when there's no clear right answer.

You need perspective from someone who's been in the room. Who understands board dynamics not theoretically, but practically. Who can help you see what you can't see from inside the situation.

---

**The Approach:**

Board advisory isn't about telling you what to do. It's about helping you see more clearly so you can make better decisions.

Craig works with board members, NEDs, and chairs on:
- **Governance design and improvement** – structures, processes, and frameworks that strengthen board effectiveness
- **Strategic decision support** – objective perspective on complex strategic choices
- **Stakeholder relationship navigation** – managing shareholder, regulator, and executive dynamics
- **Board dynamics and effectiveness** – addressing dysfunction, improving collaboration, optimizing decision-making
- **Succession and risk oversight** – planning for transitions and managing enterprise-level risks

Every engagement is confidential, independent, and designed around your specific governance challenge.

As an IoD Ambassador and someone who's chaired boards across sectors, Craig brings both formal governance expertise and the practical wisdom that comes from 17 years of accountability at board level.

---

**The Outcomes:**

Clients typically achieve:

1. **Greater strategic clarity** on complex board-level decisions
2. **Stronger governance frameworks** that improve board effectiveness without adding bureaucracy
3. **Better stakeholder relationships** through understanding of dynamics and strategic communication
4. **Increased confidence** in navigating difficult board situations
5. **Reduced governance risk** through proactive identification and mitigation

Timeline varies by challenge—some engagements are single intensive sessions for specific decisions; others are ongoing advisory relationships spanning months or years.

---

**Who This Is For:**

This service is designed for:
- **Board chairs** navigating complex governance challenges or board dysfunction
- **Non-executive directors** seeking objective perspective on specific board situations
- **Board members** preparing for increased responsibility (e.g., committee chair, senior NED roles)
- **Executives preparing for NED roles** who need to understand board dynamics from the director side

Common engagement structures:
- One-off advisory sessions for specific decisions
- Quarterly advisory retainers for ongoing board support
- Board effectiveness reviews and improvement facilitation
- Preparation coaching for new board roles

---

**How to Begin:**

Start with a confidential strategy call to discuss your governance challenge and explore whether Craig's experience and approach are the right fit.

No obligation. No pressure. Just a focused conversation about your situation and potential paths forward.

**CTA:** "Book a Confidential Board Advisory Call"

### SERVICE PAGE 2: Executive Coaching

**Hero:**
**H1:** "Executive Coaching for Senior Leaders"
**Subheadline:** "Develop leadership capability, strategic clarity, and executive effectiveness through coaching that combines psychological insight with real-world board-level experience."
**CTA:** "Explore Executive Coaching"

---

**The Challenge:**

Senior leadership is isolating. The higher you climb, the fewer people you can be honest with about the challenges you're facing.

You're expected to have all the answers, project confidence, navigate political complexity, and deliver results—often in environments where ambiguity is high and support is low.

Generic executive coaching rarely helps because it's either too soft (focusing on feelings without driving performance) or too rigid (applying frameworks that don't account for your specific context and constraints).

What you need is coaching that understands the realities of executive pressure: stakeholder management, board relationships, organizational politics, strategic complexity, and the personal toll of leadership responsibility.

You need someone who's been there. Who knows what C-suite and board-level leadership actually feels like. Who can help you develop both the strategic clarity and the psychological resilience to lead effectively under pressure.

---

**The Approach:**

Executive coaching with Craig is performance-focused, psychologically-informed, and rooted in strategic reality.

Typical coaching engagements focus on:
- **Leadership effectiveness** – developing executive presence, decision-making confidence, and strategic thinking
- **Navigating complexity** – managing stakeholder dynamics, organizational politics, and board relationships
- **Transition preparation** – preparing for C-suite or board-level roles
- **Strategic clarity** – gaining perspective on career direction, organizational challenges, or leadership dilemmas
- **Performance optimization** – identifying and removing barriers to leadership effectiveness

Sessions combine structured inquiry, strategic challenge, and practical accountability. This isn't therapy (though psychological insight informs the work). It's focused development designed to improve your leadership capability and decision-making quality.

Craig brings both FCMI Fellowship-level expertise in leadership development and the practical insight of 17 years at board level. He knows what effective senior leadership looks like because he's done the work—and continues to do it.

---

**The Outcomes:**

Clients typically experience:

1. **Greater clarity** on leadership challenges and strategic decisions
2. **Stronger executive presence** and confidence in high-stakes situations
3. **Improved decision-making** under pressure and uncertainty
4. **Better stakeholder relationships** through understanding of dynamics and strategic influence
5. **Increased resilience** and sustainable leadership effectiveness

Coaching is typically structured as:
- **3-6 month engagements** with bi-weekly or monthly sessions
- **Focused on specific leadership challenges** (transition, performance, strategic clarity)
- **Includes accountability and between-session work** for measurable progress

---

**Who This Is For:**

This service is designed for:
- **C-suite executives** navigating strategic complexity and stakeholder dynamics
- **Senior directors** preparing for board-level or expanded leadership roles
- **Newly-appointed leaders** transitioning into significantly greater responsibility
- **Experienced executives** seeking objective perspective and strategic clarity

This is not:
- Generic leadership development (go to a program for that)
- Therapy or counseling (important, but different work)
- Motivational coaching (you don't need cheerleading; you need challenge and clarity)

---

**How to Begin:**

Start with an exploratory coaching call to discuss your leadership challenge and whether coaching is the right approach.

We'll explore:
- What you're navigating right now
- What success looks like for you
- Whether Craig's coaching approach fits your needs
- What engagement structure makes sense

No obligation. If coaching isn't the right fit, you'll still walk away with clarity.

### SERVICE PAGE 3: Strategic Consulting

**Hero:**
**H1:** "Strategic Consulting for Complex Challenges"
**Subheadline:** "Objective, experienced perspective on organizational challenges that don't fit neatly into frameworks—transformation, repositioning, cultural evolution, and strategic inflection points."
**CTA:** "Start a Strategic Conversation"

---

**The Challenge:**

Some strategic challenges can't be solved with off-the-shelf frameworks or generic consulting methodologies.

Organizational transformation that requires both structural change and cultural evolution. Market repositioning that demands understanding of competitive dynamics and internal capability. M&A integration that's as much about human dynamics as operational synergy.

These are messy, complex problems with multiple stakeholders, competing priorities, organizational constraints, and no clear playbook.

Traditional consulting often fails because:
- It's framework-driven rather than context-driven
- It produces impressive reports that don't account for implementation reality
- Consultants lack operational experience to understand real constraints
- Advice is generic rather than tailored to your specific situation

You need strategic perspective from someone who understands both the analytical rigor and the human messiness of organizational change. Someone who's led transformation, not just studied it.

---

**The Approach:**

Strategic consulting with Craig starts with understanding your specific context, constraints, and desired outcomes—not applying a predetermined framework.

Typical consulting engagements focus on:
- **Organizational transformation** – structural, cultural, and operational change programs
- **Strategic repositioning** – market strategy, competitive positioning, and growth planning
- **M&A integration** – combining organizations with attention to both structure and culture
- **Board and leadership team facilitation** – working through complex strategic decisions
- **Cultural evolution** – shifting organizational culture to support strategic goals

The methodology combines:
1. **Deep contextual understanding** – extensive stakeholder engagement to understand the full picture
2. **Strategic analysis** – rigorous examination of data, market dynamics, and organizational capability
3. **Human insight** – understanding the cultural, political, and relationship dynamics that shape outcomes
4. **Implementation focus** – advice designed for real-world execution, not theoretical perfection

Every engagement is tailored. No cookie-cutter solutions. No frameworks forced into situations where they don't fit.

---

**The Outcomes:**

Clients typically achieve:

1. **Strategic clarity** on complex, multi-dimensional challenges
2. **Action plans** that account for real organizational constraints and capabilities
3. **Stakeholder alignment** through facilitation of difficult strategic conversations
4. **Implementation support** that goes beyond recommendations to actual execution
5. **Measurable progress** on transformation, repositioning, or strategic objectives

Engagement timelines vary:
- **Short-term** (4-8 weeks): Focused strategic assessments or decision support
- **Medium-term** (3-6 months): Transformation planning and initial implementation
- **Long-term** (6-12+ months): Comprehensive transformation or cultural evolution programs

---

**Who This Is For:**

This service is designed for:
- **CEOs and leadership teams** navigating organizational transformation
- **Boards** facing strategic inflection points or major decisions
- **Organizations in transition** – growth, restructuring, repositioning, or M&A
- **Complex challenges** that resist simple solutions or generic frameworks

This is not:
- Generic strategy development (if you need a strategic plan template, hire a traditional firm)
- Operational consulting (we focus on strategic, not day-to-day operational challenges)
- Implementation-only work (we design and advise; execution stays with you)

---

**How to Begin:**

Start with a strategic conversation to explore your challenge and discuss potential approaches.

We'll discuss:
- What you're trying to achieve
- What constraints and complexities you're navigating
- What approaches might work for your specific situation
- Whether Craig's experience and methodology are the right fit

**CTA:** "Book a Strategic Consultation"

---

### SERVICE PAGE 4: Business Coaching

**Hero:**
**H1:** "Business Coaching for Ambitious Leaders"
**Subheadline:** "Build sustainable business growth with coaching that balances strategic ambition with operational reality—for business owners and leaders who want more than generic advice."
**CTA:** "Accelerate Your Business Growth"

---

**The Challenge:**

Building a valuable business is hard. Scaling without losing what made you successful is harder. Maintaining momentum while managing complexity is hardest.

You're navigating growth challenges, operational constraints, market dynamics, team development, and financial pressure—often without a peer group who understands the specific challenges of your stage and sector.

Generic business coaching tends to be either:
- Too tactical (focused on systems and processes without strategic context)
- Too motivational (cheerleading without accountability or substance)
- Too framework-driven (one-size-fits-all methodologies that don't fit your reality)

What you need is coaching that combines strategic perspective, operational understanding, and accountability—from someone who's built and scaled organizations, not just studied them.

---

**The Approach:**

Business coaching with Craig is designed for ambitious leaders who want to build valuable, sustainable businesses.

Typical coaching engagements focus on:
- **Strategic clarity** – defining where you're going and why it matters
- **Growth strategy** – scaling revenue, market position, and organizational capability
- **Operational discipline** – building systems and processes that support growth
- **Decision-making confidence** – making better calls on investment, hiring, and strategy
- **Leadership development** – growing your capability as the business grows in complexity

Coaching combines:
1. **Strategic questioning** that clarifies thinking and exposes assumptions
2. **Business experience** from building and advising growing organizations
3. **Accountability mechanisms** that ensure progress between sessions
4. **Practical tools** that improve decision-making and execution

This isn't about motivation or feel-good coaching. It's about building business capability and achieving measurable results.

---

**The Outcomes:**

Clients typically achieve:

1. **Clearer business strategy** aligned with personal values and market reality
2. **Stronger operational discipline** that supports sustainable growth
3. **Better decision-making** on investment, hiring, and strategic priorities
4. **Increased revenue and profitability** through focus and execution
5. **Greater confidence** in navigating growth challenges and market uncertainty

Coaching is typically structured as:
- **6-12 month engagements** with bi-weekly or monthly sessions
- **Focused on specific growth challenges** (scaling, positioning, operational optimization)
- **Includes between-session accountability** and progress tracking

---

**Who This Is For:**

This service is designed for:
- **Business owners** scaling from founder-led to professionally-managed organizations
- **Managing directors** navigating growth, market positioning, or operational challenges
- **Entrepreneurial leaders** building valuable businesses, not just lifestyle income
- **Ambitious teams** where the leader wants external strategic perspective and accountability

This is not:
- Startup coaching (if you're pre-product-market fit, you need different support)
- Life coaching (we focus on business performance, not personal fulfillment)
- Mentoring (coaching is about your development, not my advice-giving)

---

**How to Begin:**

Start with a business coaching call to explore whether coaching is the right fit for your current stage and challenges.

We'll discuss:
- Where your business is now and where you want it to go
- What's working and what's holding you back
- Whether coaching is the right approach for your situation
- What engagement structure makes sense for your goals

### SERVICE PAGE 5: Organizational Wellbeing Audits

**Hero:**
**H1:** "Wellbeing Audits That Drive Performance"
**Subheadline:** "Understand the true state of organizational wellbeing with human-AI analysis that surfaces patterns invisible to traditional surveys—and get strategic insights that connect culture, performance, and growth."
**CTA:** "Audit Your Organization"

---

**The Challenge:**

Most organizations measure employee engagement but don't understand wellbeing. They collect survey data but miss the cultural patterns that drive retention, performance, and innovation.

Traditional engagement surveys are limited by:
- **Surface-level data** – numeric scores that don't explain *why* people feel how they feel
- **Survey fatigue** – declining response rates and gaming of questions
- **Generic insights** – results that don't account for your specific culture and context
- **Action gaps** – reports that identify problems without providing strategic solutions

What you need is deeper understanding of the wellbeing patterns, cultural dynamics, and organizational factors that drive performance outcomes.

You need analysis that combines quantitative rigor with qualitative insight. That uses advanced pattern recognition to surface issues that traditional methods miss. That connects wellbeing data to strategic business outcomes.

---

**The Approach:**

Wellbeing audits with Craig combine human expertise with AI-powered pattern recognition to deliver insights that traditional surveys can't provide.

The methodology:
1. **Comprehensive data collection** – surveys, qualitative interviews, cultural analysis, and performance metrics
2. **AI-powered pattern recognition** – identifying wellbeing themes, sentiment patterns, and correlations invisible to traditional analysis
3. **Human strategic interpretation** – Craig's FRSPH Fellowship expertise contextualizes data within your organizational reality
4. **Actionable recommendations** – strategic insights that connect wellbeing to performance, retention, and growth

What makes this different:
- **Depth** – Goes beyond engagement scores to understand *why* patterns exist
- **Speed** – AI analysis processes qualitative data at scale in days, not months
- **Strategic focus** – Connects wellbeing insights to business outcomes and strategic priorities
- **Practical recommendations** – Advice designed for implementation, not shelf reports

---

**The Outcomes:**

Organizations typically achieve:

1. **Deep understanding** of cultural and wellbeing patterns affecting performance
2. **Data-driven insights** that inform strategic decisions on culture, retention, and growth
3. **Actionable recommendations** that address root causes, not just symptoms
4. **Competitive advantage** through culture and wellbeing as strategic assets
5. **Measurable improvement** in retention, engagement, and performance metrics

Audit timeline: 4-6 weeks from kickoff to final report and strategic recommendations session.

---

**Who This Is For:**

This service is designed for:
- **HR leaders** who need deeper wellbeing insights to inform people strategy
- **Executives** who understand that culture and wellbeing drive performance outcomes
- **Boards** seeking evidence-based perspective on organizational health
- **Organizations** preparing for growth, transformation, or cultural evolution

This is not:
- A replacement for engagement surveys (it's complementary, deeper analysis)
- A compliance exercise (it's strategic insight, not box-checking)
- A one-time fix (wellbeing is ongoing; this provides baseline and direction)

---

**How to Begin:**

Start with an exploratory call to discuss your organization's wellbeing challenges and whether an audit is the right approach.

We'll explore:
- What you already know about organizational wellbeing
- What questions you're trying to answer
- Whether an audit will provide the insights you need
- What the audit process and timeline would look like

**CTA:** "Discuss a Wellbeing Audit"

## CREDENTIAL EXPLANATION COPY

### Problem:
Craig holds three globally-recognized Fellowships that are impressive to those who understand them—but meaningless jargon to those who don't. We need to explain their value without being condescending or losing credibility.

### Solution Framework:

**Micro-Explainers (Tooltips/Hover Text):**

"**IoD Ambassador**

### "Why These Credentials Matter"

Craig holds three Fellowships that, together, create a unique combination of expertise:

**IoD Ambassador** – The Institute of Directors is the UK's leading organization for board-level professionals. Ambassadorship recognizes exceptional expertise in board governance, director effectiveness, and strategic leadership. This credential reflects deep knowledge of how boards work, what makes them effective, and how to navigate complex governance challenges.

**FRSPH Fellow** – The Royal Society for Public Health is the independent, multi-disciplinary charity dedicated to improving and protecting public health. Fellowship requires demonstrated leadership in advancing health and wellbeing. This credential reflects Craig's expertise in organizational wellbeing, mental health strategy, and the connection between culture, wellbeing, and performance.

**FCMI Fellow** – The Chartered Management Institute is Europe's largest professional body for management and leadership. Fellowship—the highest level of membership—recognizes mastery of management practice and sustained contribution to the field. This credential reflects comprehensive leadership expertise across strategy, operations, and organizational development.

**Why this combination matters:**
Most advisors have expertise in one of these areas. Very few have formal recognition across all three. This combination means Craig brings board governance expertise, wellbeing and culture insight, and management mastery to every engagement.

It's not about credentials for their own sake. It's about the depth and breadth of expertise they represent—and how that translates into better advice, clearer strategy, and more effective outcomes for clients.
