## Marketing Agency Perspectives

### Source 1: Newfangled - Agency Homepage Best Practices

**Core Philosophy**: "An agency's home page does not exist to excite or entertain an audience. It exists to attract, inform, and engage future clients."

#### The Four Essential Elements (In Priority Order)

1. **What You Do** (Positioning Statement)
   - Your promise and positioning
   - Horizontal positioning (what you do)
   - Vertical positioning (for whom you have greatest impact)
   - Must be brief and guide to "learn more"
   - Should qualify/disqualify prospects immediately

2. **What You've Done** (Case Studies/Results)
   - Your work and proven results
   - Feature 1-2 positioning-relevant case studies
   - Brief summaries that direct deeper into site
   - Client logos should not overshadow your brand

3. **What Your Clients Say** (Social Proof)
   - Testimonials from satisfied clients
   - "A satisfied client will always be a better salesperson than you"
   - Connect testimonials to specific case studies
   - Use to direct visitors deeper into relevant content

4. **What You Say** (Content/Expertise)
   - Evidence of expertise: blogs, white papers, webinars
   - Should be LAST priority, not first
   - Common mistake: agencies prioritize this because it changes frequently
   - Homepage is for new visitors, not returning users

#### Key Principles

- **Business Purpose Over Personality**: Balance is key, but most agencies over-emphasize personality
- **Priority Over Aesthetics**: Information prioritization matters more than visual treatment
- **Single-Focus Option**: Can work if focused on positioning, NOT on portfolio
- **Client Brand Warning**: Don't put client's brand before yours (common mistake with portfolio-first homepages)

#### Additional Elements (Optional but Common)

- **Qualifications Row**: "We can help if..." pain points
- **Services List**: Specific offerings (but keep secondary to positioning)
- **Industry Focus**: Vertical market specialization
