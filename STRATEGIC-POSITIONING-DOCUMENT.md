# 🎯 LIGHTHOUSE MENTORING - STRATEGIC POSITIONING RECOMMENDATION
**Website Transformation Strategy Based on Craig Fearn's Business Goals**
*Generated: January 2025 - After Strategic Discovery Session*

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current Reality**:
- 100% wellbeing consulting revenue from H&S word-of-mouth
- 0 NED positions despite IoD Ambassador status + FRSPH + FCMI
- Website generates ZERO inquiries
- Site leads with wellbeing (1,000 searches/month)

**Target Reality**:
- 40% NED/Board Advisory (4-5 positions @ £20K-£50K each = £80K-£250K)
- 20% Executive Coaching
- 20% Management Consulting
- 10% Wellbeing Consulting
- 10% Speaking/Thought Leadership

**The Core Problem**: Website positioning doesn't match business goals. Craig has globally unique credentials for NED work but isn't positioned to capture that market.

**The Opportunity**: "Non executive director" = 5,400 searches/month with LOW competition. This is Craig's biggest untapped market.

---

## 🎯 THE STRATEGIC CHALLENGE

### What Craig WANTS to Do (Energized By):
✅ Sitting on boards in group settings
✅ Board meetings and strategic discussions
✅ Group meetings and collaborative environments

### What Craig DOESN'T Want (Drained By):
❌ Detailed audit work
❌ Long solo consulting projects
❌ Administrative deep-dives

### Current Revenue Reality:
| Service | Current % | Desired % | Gap |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Wellbeing Consulting** | 100% | 10% | -90% |
| **NED/Board Advisory** | 0% | 40% | +40% |
| **Executive Coaching** | 0% | 20% | +20% |
| **Management Consulting** | 0% | 20% | +20% |
| **Speaking/Thought Leadership** | 0% | 10% | +10% |

### Current Client Acquisition:
- **Source**: 100% word-of-mouth from Health & Safety networks
- **Website inquiries**: ZERO
- **IoD networking**: Difficult due to location/event attendance
- **NED platforms**: On them but not getting traction
- **Blockers**: Competition and location (but has virtual capability)

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Isn't Craig Getting NED Work?

**1. Positioning Mismatch**
- Site leads with "IoD Wellbeing Ambassador" (niche, wellbeing-focused)
- But boards want "Non Executive Director" (governance, strategy, oversight)
- Wellbeing is a DIFFERENTIATOR not PRIMARY positioning

**2. Network Mismatch**
- Current network: H&S professionals (wellbeing buyers)
- Target network: Board chairs, CEOs, nomination committees (NED buyers)
- These are DIFFERENT decision-makers with different priorities

**3. Visibility Mismatch**
- Wellbeing consultants search "workplace wellbeing" (1,000/month)
- Board recruiters search "non executive director" (5,400/month)
- Craig isn't visible where NED buyers are looking

**4. Credibility Presentation**
- Site emphasizes wellbeing expertise
- But NED buyers want: governance experience, strategic insight, sector knowledge
- Craig has all this (IoD Ambassador + FCMI Fellow + 17 years board experience) but it's buried

**5. Platform Friction**
- On NED recruitment platforms but no traction
- Likely because profile emphasizes wellbeing, not board governance
- Board recruiters filter by "governance experience" not "wellbeing expertise"

---

## 💡 THE STRATEGIC SOLUTION

### Core Positioning Shift

**FROM**: "IoD Wellbeing Ambassador helping organizations with wellbeing strategy"

**TO**: "Non Executive Director & Board Advisor with unique wellbeing governance expertise"

### Why This Works:

1. **Addresses Search Volume**: NED = 5,400 searches vs wellbeing = 1,000
2. **Matches Craig's Energy**: Board meetings energize him, audit work drains him
3. **Leverages Unique Credentials**: IoD Ambassador + FRSPH + FCMI combination
4. **Differentiates from Competition**: Most NEDs don't have wellbeing governance expertise
5. **Opens New Revenue**: 4-5 NED positions = £80K-£250K recurring annual revenue

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must Do:

✅ **Reposition as NED-first immediately** - Every day with wellbeing-first positioning is lost opportunity

✅ **Update ALL profiles on NED platforms** - Current profiles aren't working, need governance-first approach

✅ **Leverage IoD Ambassador status** - This is the golden ticket to board networks, use it

✅ **Attend IoD events virtually** - Can't let location be a barrier, most events now hybrid

✅ **Create NED-focused content** - Need visibility where board chairs and nomination committees search

✅ **Price for NED market** - £20K-£50K annual retainers, not project fees

✅ **Build recurring revenue** - NED positions provide stable base, allows selective project work

### Must Avoid:

❌ **Don't abandon wellbeing completely** - It's your differentiator, just not primary positioning

❌ **Don't undersell NED value** - £20K-£50K is standard, don't go lower

❌ **Don't wait for perfect website** - Update profiles and start outreach NOW

❌ **Don't rely on organic search alone** - NED recruitment is relationship-driven

❌ **Don't target every board** - Focus on growth companies (250-1,000 employees) in specific sectors

## 🎯 FINAL SUMMARY

Craig Fearn has globally unique credentials (IoD Ambassador + FRSPH + FCMI) and 17 years of board-level experience. The current website positions him as a wellbeing consultant, generating zero inquiries and 100% wellbeing revenue from word-of-mouth.

**The Strategic Shift**: Reposition as NED-first with wellbeing governance as differentiator. Target the massive opportunity ("non executive director" = 5,400 searches/month, LOW competition) where Craig's unique credentials provide competitive advantage.

**The Revenue Impact**: Securing 4-5 NED positions at £20K-£50K each = £80K-£250K recurring annual revenue with only 60-80 working days. This allows selective higher-value consulting work and achieves Craig's goal of 40% board work doing what energizes him most.

**The Implementation**: Immediate website repositioning + NED platform profile updates + targeted outreach to board chairs + thought leadership = pipeline of NED opportunities within 90 days.

**Success Criteria**: By end of Year 1, Craig should have 2-3 NED positions, £375K total revenue, and a clear path to 40% board work by Year 2.

*This strategic positioning document addresses the core business challenge: Craig wants to do board-level work that energizes him, has globally unique credentials for it, but his current positioning targets wellbeing consulting that drains him. The solution is repositioning to capture the 5,400 monthly searches for "non executive director" where he has competitive advantage.*
