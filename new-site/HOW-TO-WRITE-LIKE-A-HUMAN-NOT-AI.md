# How to Write Like a Human (Not AI) - Complete Research Guide

**Last Updated:** October 2024
**Purpose:** Reference guide for writing natural, authentic content that doesn't sound AI-generated

---

## The Core Problem: What Makes AI Writing Detectable?

AI detection tools and human readers identify AI-generated content through two main metrics:

### 1. **Perplexity** (Word Predictability)
- Measures how predictable words are in sequence
- LOW perplexity = predictable, obvious next word
- HIGH perplexity = surprising, unexpected word choices
- **AI Problem:** AI chooses the most statistically likely next word, creating low perplexity
- **Human Pattern:** Humans make unexpected word choices, creating higher perplexity

**Example:**
- Low perplexity (AI): "I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of red **wine**"
- High perplexity (Human): "I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of red **jelly beans**"

### 2. **Burstiness** (Sentence Variation)
- Measures variance in sentence length, structure, and rhythm
- **AI Problem:** AI writes in uniform, medium-length sentences with consistent structure
- **Human Pattern:** Humans alternate. Short sentences. Then longer, more complex sentences that build on ideas and meander a bit before getting to the point.

**The Key Insight:** AI is too consistent. Humans are messy, varied, and unpredictable.

## How Humans Actually Write

### Sentence Variety (The Burstiness Fix)

**Bad (AI-like):**
> Executive coaching is a valuable tool for leadership development. It helps leaders improve their performance. Many executives find it beneficial. The process typically takes six months. Results can be significant.

**Good (Human-like):**
> Executive coaching works. Not always, but often enough that it's worth considering. The typical engagement runs about six months, though I've seen transformative work happen in three and I've seen people spin their wheels for a year. It depends on the person, the coach, and whether you're actually ready to do the work.

**The Pattern:**
- Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, flowing ones
- Vary your rhythm
- Some sentences are fragments. Incomplete.
- Others ramble a bit because that's how people think when they're working through an idea, trying to capture something complex, and they need the space to unfold it properly.

### Real Voice Techniques

**1. Use Contractions**
- Don't write "do not" - write "don't"
- It's not "it is" - it's "it's"
- You're not "you are" - you're "you're"
- Won't, can't, shouldn't, wouldn't

**2. Start Sentences with Conjunctions (Sometimes)**
- "And here's the thing..."
- "But that's not the whole story."
- "Or maybe I'm wrong about this."
- "So what does this mean?"

**3. Use Casual Connectors**
- "Look"
- "Here's the thing"
- "To be honest"
- "Let's be real"
- "I'll tell you what"
- "The truth is"
- "Actually"

**4. Address the Reader Directly**
- "You know what I mean."
- "Think about it."
- "You've probably experienced this."
- "Let me guess."
- "Chances are..."

**5. Express Uncertainty and Caveats**
- "I might be wrong, but..."
- "At least, that's been my experience."
- "Maybe that's just me."
- "I'm not sure about this, but..."
- "Could be confirmation bias."

**6. Use Personal Examples**
- "I worked with a CEO last year who..."
- "I've sat in those board meetings."
- "The executive who called me last month..."
- NOT generic: "Many executives experience..."
- YES specific: "Sarah, a CFO I coached, told me..."

**7. Break the Fourth Wall**
- "Let me be clear about something."
- "Before you roll your eyes..."
- "I know what you're thinking."
- "Stay with me here."
- "Here's where it gets interesting."

**8. Show Thinking Process**
- "At first I thought X, but then I realized Y"
- "This confused me until..."
- "The more I think about it..."
- "On one hand... but on the other..."

**9. Use Rhetorical Devices**
- Questions: "What does that actually mean?"
- Repetition for emphasis: "Not just in theory. Not just in research. In real organizations."
- Lists that build: "The culture was toxic. The turnover was high. The best people were leaving."

**10. Add Specificity**
- NOT: "Organizations often struggle with wellbeing"
- YES: "I worked with a tech company burning through £200k a year in turnover"
- NOT: "Research shows benefits"
- YES: "Deloitte's 2024 study put the number at £51 billion"

## The Craig Ferguson Technique (Conversational Style)

Craig Ferguson, late-night host, famously ripped up his interview note cards on camera. His techniques for authentic conversation translate to writing:

### Ferguson's Key Moves:

**1. Spontaneity Over Structure**
- Don't stick to a rigid outline
- Follow tangents that feel natural
- Trust "the stuff in-between"
- Let ideas emerge organically

**2. Self-Deprecating Humor**
- "I might be completely wrong about this"
- "Maybe I'm overthinking it"
- "At least, that's what I tell myself"
- Admit uncertainty and limitations

**3. Genuine Curiosity**
- Ask questions you actually want answered
- Explore unexpected angles
- Don't just state facts - wonder about them
- "What I've never understood is..."

**4. High Energy Opening**
- Start with something that grabs attention
- Use strong, direct language
- Create momentum from the first sentence
- Example: "Let me guess. Someone in your organization has proposed investing more in workplace wellbeing. And you're sitting there thinking: is this actually going to make a difference?"

**5. Playful Teasing**
- Gentle challenge to assumptions
- "Before you roll your eyes..."
- "Sure, but..."
- Call out the elephant in the room

## Practical Application: Before & After Examples

### Example 1: Opening Paragraph

**AI Version (Bad):**
> Executive coaching has emerged as a valuable tool for leadership development in modern organizations. It is important to note that coaching differs significantly from mentoring. This article will explore the key differences between these two approaches and help executives understand which option might be most suitable for their development needs.

**Human Version (Good):**
> The executive who called me last month had already worked with two coaches. Neither engagement produced the transformation she'd hoped for. As we talked through her experiences, a pattern emerged: she'd selected coaches based primarily on credentials and cost, without clarity about what she actually needed or how to assess whether a particular coach could provide it.

**Why It Works:**
- Starts with a real story
- Uses contractions ("she'd")
- Varies sentence length
- Specific details (two coaches, last month)
- No transition words like "moreover"
- Shows rather than tells

### Example 2: Making a Point

**AI Version (Bad):**
> Organizations should prioritize workplace wellbeing initiatives. Research demonstrates that employee wellbeing significantly impacts productivity and retention. Moreover, companies with strong wellbeing programs experience lower absence rates and higher employee engagement. It is therefore crucial for leadership teams to invest in comprehensive wellbeing strategies.

**Human Version (Good):**
> Here's the uncomfortable truth most boards don't want to hear: your wellbeing initiative is probably a waste of money. Not because wellbeing doesn't matter—it absolutely does. But because most organizations treat it as an HR side project rather than a strategic imperative. You can't yoga-class your way out of a toxic culture.

**Why It Works:**
- Direct, provocative opening
- Conversational tone ("Here's the thing")
- Uses contractions
- Makes a specific claim with edge
- Short, punchy sentences mixed with longer ones
- Personality and opinion

### Example 3: Transition Between Ideas

**AI Version (Bad):**
> Furthermore, it is essential to consider the qualifications of potential coaches. Professional coaching bodies such as EMCC provide credentialing systems. These credentials indicate varying levels of training and experience. Additionally, coaches should demonstrate ongoing professional development.

**Human Version (Good):**
> So how do you actually choose a coach? The credential letters after someone's name matter, but they don't tell the whole story. I've met EMCC Master Practitioners who are terrible coaches and Foundation-level coaches who are brilliant. The certification tells you they passed the test. It doesn't tell you if they can actually help you.

**Why It Works:**
- Question as transition
- Acknowledges complexity ("but they don't tell the whole story")
- Contrasts expectations with reality
- Specific examples
- Conversational connector ("So")
- Natural speech pattern

## The Editing Process: From AI to Human

### Step 1: Identify AI Patterns
Run through the text looking for:
- ✗ Overused AI words (delve, robust, comprehensive)
- ✗ Formal transitions (moreover, furthermore, additionally)
- ✗ Perfect paragraph length
- ✗ Consistent sentence structure
- ✗ No contractions
- ✗ Generic examples
- ✗ Hedge words everywhere

### Step 2: Add Human Elements
- ✓ Personal anecdotes or examples
- ✓ Questions (rhetorical or direct)
- ✓ Varied sentence lengths
- ✓ Contractions
- ✓ Casual connectors
- ✓ Direct address ("you")
- ✓ Opinion and personality

### Step 3: Test Read-Out-Loud
- Does it sound like something you'd actually say?
- Would you talk like this to a colleague?
- Are there awkward phrases that trip you up?
- Does it have rhythm and flow?

### Step 4: Check Specificity
- Replace generic statements with specific examples
- Add numbers, names, details
- Ground abstractions in reality
- Show, don't just tell

## Red Flags You're Still Too AI-Like

1. **Every paragraph is the same length** - Real writing is messy
2. **No sentence starts with And, But, Or, So** - Humans do this all the time
3. **You could swap any paragraph order** - Means it's too formulaic
4. **Reading it aloud sounds like a textbook** - Should sound conversational
5. **No personality shows through** - Whose voice is this?
6. **Every sentence is qualified** - "might," "could," "perhaps" overused
7. **No humor, no edge, no opinion** - Too safe, too bland
8. **Abstract throughout** - No concrete examples
9. **Perfect grammar and structure** - Sometimes breaking rules adds authenticity
10. **You're bored reading it** - If you're bored, readers will be too

---

## The Secret Weapon: Personal Voice

The single biggest difference between AI and human writing is **personal voice**. AI has no experiences, no opinions, no personality. It can only remix patterns it's seen.

**Questions to Find Your Voice:**
- What would I say about this over coffee?
- What's the one thing I believe that others might disagree with?
- What story from my experience illustrates this?
- What pisses me off about how this topic is usually discussed?
- What surprised me when I learned this?
- What would I tell a friend who asked about this?

**Your voice is what AI can't replicate.**

## Final Thought

The goal isn't to "trick" AI detectors. It's to write in a way that's genuinely more engaging, more memorable, and more human.

AI writes like a very smart person who's never had an interesting experience. Humans write with the mess, personality, and specificity of actual lived experience.

Be messy. Be specific. Be you.

That's what AI can't replicate.

## Advanced Techniques: Professional Copywriter Secrets

### Write Like You Talk (But Better)

Professional copywriters follow a simple rule: **"Write the way you talk—only a little better."**

**Key Principles:**
- Keep sentences between 14-20 words for optimal readability
- Use first-person ("I," "we") and second-person ("you") pronouns
- Treat your reader like a "business BFF"—dishing out knowledge directly FOR them
- Mix shorter sentences for emphasis with slightly longer ones for explanation

**Why This Matters in 2024:**
With AI and ChatGPT creating similar-sounding content everywhere, sounding normal actually makes you stand out. AI lacks human warmth and emotional intelligence—conversational writers create emotional connections that build trust.

### The Show vs. Tell Principle

One of the most powerful writing techniques is showing rather than telling. This creates actual experience instead of just discussing things abstractly.

**The Difference:**

**Abstract (Telling):**
> "The man was cold."

**Specific (Showing):**
> He shivered and pulled up his flannel scarf. He ducked his head against the bitter December air.

**Abstract (Telling):**
> "Poor mental health costs UK employers money."

**Specific (Showing):**
> Deloitte put a number on it: £51 billion per year. That's not a typo. Fifty-one billion pounds. And that's just mental health—doesn't include physical health issues, stress-related absence, or the slow drain of having a workforce counting down to Friday.

**Business Application:**
In business writing, plenty of telling is acceptable (reports, technical instructions), but strategic use of showing makes content memorable. Instead of saying "Our service helped them," describe the specific outcome: "Three months later, their turnover dropped by 40%."

### Rhythm and Cadence: The Music of Prose

Professional writers understand that prose has "hidden rhythms" and "music beneath the surface" that readers recognize unconsciously.

**What Is Cadence?**
- **Rhythm** = the stress patterns of words and punctuation
- **Cadence** = the timing and flow of sentences
- **Goal** = Create energy, texture, and movement in your writing

**Dean Koontz's Approach:**
One of the "kings of cadence," Koontz explains that if every sentence has the same rhythm, prose starts to feel flat. Professional writers:
- Intersperse short sentences for impact
- Use longer sentences for flow and explanation
- Create staccato effects with brief statements
- Build flowing passages with extended thoughts

**Practical Test:**
Read your writing aloud. Do you stumble? Does the rhythm drag? Are there awkward breaks? Your ear will catch what your eye misses.

**Example:**

**Flat Rhythm (AI-like):**
> Coaching is effective. It helps executives. Many benefit from it. The process works well. Results are positive.

**Dynamic Rhythm (Human-like):**
> Coaching works. Not always. But often enough that it's worth considering. The typical engagement runs about six months, though I've seen transformative work happen in three and I've seen people spin their wheels for a year without progress.

Notice the variation? Short. Medium. Then a longer, flowing sentence that builds momentum.

### Storytelling and Narrative Techniques

Stories transform mundane facts into emotional narratives that engage, inspire, and provoke action. Here's how to use narrative in business writing:

**1. Hero's Journey (Simplified)**
Every transformation story follows a pattern:
- **Before state** (the problem)
- **Turning point** (seeking help)
- **Journey** (the work)
- **After state** (the transformation)

**Example:**
> The CEO I worked with last year was burning out. Seventy-hour weeks, board pressure, couldn't delegate. Six months of coaching later? She'd built a leadership team, cut her hours by 30%, and the business was performing better than ever.

**2. Nested Loops**
Layer stories within stories, each revealing deeper meaning.

**Example:**
> Here's what's interesting about wellbeing ROI. Deloitte found £51 billion in annual costs. But when I talk to boards, they focus on that number. What they miss—and what the CFO at a manufacturing firm showed me last month—is that the cost is hiding in plain sight. Their absence rate looked normal. 4.2%. Industry standard. But when we dug into the data... [story continues]

**3. Building Suspense**
Use foreshadowing, withhold information temporarily, introduce cliffhangers:
> The board meeting started like any other. Until the Finance Director said something that stopped everyone cold.

**4. Emotional Truth**
Create connection through specific, vivid details that evoke feeling:
> The notification popped up at 11:47pm. Another Slack message. She stared at her phone, then at her sleeping daughter, then back at the phone. The message could wait until morning. But would it?

### The David Ogilvy Principles (Timeless Copywriting)

David Ogilvy, the "Father of Advertising," established principles that remain remarkably relevant:

**1. The More You Tell, The More You Sell**
> "The more informative your advertising, the more persuasive it will be."

Don't be afraid of detail. When asking people to spend money or make decisions, give them substance.

**2. Respect Your Reader**
> "A consumer is not a moron. She's your wife. Don't insult her intelligence."

Write for intelligent people. No jargon. No condescension. Just clear, respectful communication.

**3. Research First**
> "There is no substitute for homework. The more you know about a product, the more likely you are to come up with a big idea for selling it."

Don't write without understanding deeply. Research makes the difference between surface content and something substantive.

**4. Write Naturally**
> "Write the way you talk. Naturally. Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs."

And crucially: **"Never use jargon words like reconceptualize, demassification, attitudinally, judgmentally. They are hallmarks of a pretentious ass."**

**5. Be Specific**
Use concrete numbers and precise details. Not "Our clients see great results" but "Last quarter, three clients saw 25-40% reduction in turnover within six months."

### Using Humor in Business Writing

Humor is risky but powerful when done right. Here's how to use it without faceplanting:

**When to Use Humor:**
- To warm up your audience before making serious points
- As a "small reward" for getting through something dry
- Right before delivering your most important message (people are most receptive after laughing)
- To diffuse tension or create connection

**Safe Humor Approaches:**
- **Observational comedy** about industry frustrations everyone recognizes
- **Mild self-deprecation** that makes you relatable
- **Gentle irony** about common situations
- **Understated humor** rather than trying to be hilarious

**Example:**
> Let me guess. Someone in your organization has proposed investing more in workplace wellbeing. And you're sitting there thinking: "Is this actually going to make a difference, or is this just another feel-good initiative that sounds nice in theory?"

Not a joke, exactly. But the recognition creates a smile and connection.

**Danger Zones:**
- Never at someone else's expense
- Avoid sarcasm (doesn't translate well in writing)
- Remember written jokes are permanent—once sent, they live forever
- Don't force it—connection matters more than laughs

**Stanford Research Finding:**
The best time to make a serious point is right after people laugh. They're more receptive, more open, more willing to listen.

### Conversational Techniques That Work

**1. Ask Real Questions**
Not rhetorical fluff—questions that genuinely advance thinking:
> What actually drives wellbeing ROI? Not the programs you run. The culture you build.

**2. Use Parentheticals**
Add asides that create intimacy:
> The research is clear (and I mean really clear, not "studies suggest" clear) that wellbeing investment pays off.

**3. Strategic Repetition**
Repeat key phrases for emphasis:
> Not in theory. Not in research papers. In real organizations, with real people, getting real results.

**4. Anticipate Objections**
> You're thinking: "But we already have a wellbeing program." Right. And how's that working?

**5. Break the Fourth Wall**
Acknowledge the writing itself:
> Look, I know this sounds like consultant speak. But stay with me, because the numbers tell a story most boards aren't hearing.

**6. Use "You" Liberally**
Make it about the reader:
> You've probably sat in those meetings. Where wellbeing gets fifteen minutes at the end of the agenda, right before everyone needs to leave.

### Advanced Specificity Techniques

Generic statements are AI's trademark. Specificity is yours.

**Technique 1: Name Real Organizations**
- NOT: "Research shows benefits"
- YES: "Deloitte's 2024 study found £51 billion in annual costs"

**Technique 2: Use Exact Numbers**
- NOT: "Significant improvement"
- YES: "Turnover dropped from 23% to 14% in eight months"

**Technique 3: Cite Real Examples**
- NOT: "Many executives struggle with this"
- YES: "The CFO I coached last month said something that stuck with me..."

**Technique 4: Be Precise with Time**
- NOT: "Recently"
- YES: "Last Tuesday" or "In October 2023"

**Technique 5: Quote Actual Words**
- NOT: "They were frustrated"
- YES: "She said, 'I'm tired of throwing money at programs that don't work.'"

### The Voice Development Process

Finding your authentic voice takes work. Here's how:

**Step 1: Write Like You're Emailing a Smart Friend**
Imagine explaining this to someone who's intelligent but doesn't know your field. How would you break it down? What comparisons would you use? What would you emphasize?

**Step 2: Record Yourself Talking**
Literally. Record yourself explaining the concept out loud. Then transcribe it. You'll find natural phrases, rhythm, and structure you'd never write artificially.

**Step 3: Identify Your Verbal Tics (and Keep Some)**
We all have phrases we use. "Here's the thing." "Look." "What's interesting is..." Don't sanitize all of them—they're part of your voice.

**Step 4: Find Your Edge**
What do you believe that others might disagree with? Where do you have strong opinions? That's where personality lives. Don't be controversial for its own sake, but don't be bland either.

**Step 5: Read Writers You Admire**
Not to copy them, but to understand how they create voice. What makes their writing distinctive? How do they structure sentences? When do they break rules?

### Practical Evasion Techniques (2024 Updated)

If you're specifically trying to avoid AI detection:

**1. Inject Unpredictability**
AI detectors look for predictable patterns. Throw in:
- Unexpected word choices
- Unusual (but appropriate) metaphors
- Questions where statements are expected
- Occasional colloquialisms

**2. Vary Everything**
- Sentence length (3 words to 40 words in same paragraph)
- Paragraph length (one sentence to ten sentences)
- Sentence structure (simple, compound, complex, fragments)
- Voice (switch between active and passive occasionally)

**3. Add Current References**
- Cite recent news (last 3 months)
- Reference current events
- Use 2024/2025 data
- Include this year's research

**4. Include Imperfections**
- Occasional sentence fragments
- Starting with And/But/So
- Minor grammatical "errors" that sound natural
- Informal punctuation (em dashes, ellipses... used naturally)

**5. Overuse Transitionals Less**
AI loves "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally." Replace with:
- "And another thing"
- "Here's what's interesting"
- "But wait"
- "The real issue?"
- Or just start the new idea directly

**Important Note:** The goal isn't to trick detectors. It's to write better. These techniques make writing more engaging whether AI detectors exist or not.

## Case Study: Complete Transformation

**BEFORE (AI-Generated):**

> Executive coaching has become increasingly important in modern organizations. It is essential to note that effective coaching requires proper qualifications and experience. Moreover, executives should carefully consider their needs before selecting a coach. Furthermore, the coaching relationship must be based on trust and mutual respect. Additionally, measurable outcomes should be established at the outset. In conclusion, executive coaching represents a valuable investment in leadership development.

**Analysis of Problems:**
- Every sentence 15-20 words
- Formal connectors (moreover, furthermore, additionally)
- No contractions
- Generic statements
- No personality
- No specific examples
- Rigid structure
- "It is essential to note"
- Concludes with "In conclusion"

**AFTER (Humanized):**

> The executive who called me last month had already tried two coaches. Neither worked out. As we talked, I heard a familiar story: she'd picked based on credentials and price, without really thinking about what she needed or how to tell if someone could actually help.

> Here's what most people get wrong about choosing a coach. They treat it like hiring a consultant—looking at qualifications, checking references, comparing rates. All reasonable. But coaching isn't consulting. The credentials tell you someone passed a test. They don't tell you if the chemistry's there, if their style fits yours, or if they can actually help with your specific challenges.

> I've met Master Practitioners who are technically brilliant but completely wrong for certain clients. And I've seen Foundation-level coaches do transformative work because they clicked with someone at exactly the right moment.

> So how do you actually choose? Start with clarity about what you need. Not "I want to be a better leader"—everyone wants that. Get specific. Are you working on delegation? Board relationships? Strategic thinking? The clearer you are, the better you can assess fit.

**Why This Works:**
- Varied sentence lengths (4 words to 30 words)
- Personal story as entry point
- Contractions throughout
- Direct address ("you")
- Opinion and edge
- Specific examples
- Natural transitions
- Questions
- Personality evident
- Sounds like actual person talking

## Final Principle: The Humanity Test

Before you publish anything, ask this one question:

**"If someone read this out loud at a conference, would the audience stay awake?"**

If the answer is no, rewrite it.

AI writes perfectly boring prose. Humans write imperfectly interesting prose.

Choose interesting.
