## üéØ RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Craig Doesn't Like New Positioning

**Mitigation**:
- Present data clearly (12,130 buyer searches vs 1,000 wellbeing)
- Show current reality (0 website inquiries, 100% word-of-mouth)
- Frame as market-driven, not arbitrary choice
- Emphasize wellbeing remains (as premium differentiator)

**Fallback**:
- Hybrid approach: Lead with "Strategic Consultant & Wellbeing Governance Expert"
- Still target strategic consultant buyers
- Keep wellbeing more prominent if Craig insists

### Risk 2: Market Doesn't Respond to Strategic Consultant Positioning

**Mitigation**:
- A/B test different hero messages
- Track which service pages get most traffic
- Monitor which CTAs convert best
- Adjust positioning based on data (not assumptions)

**Fallback**:
- Pivot to "Executive Coach" primary if that performs better
- Business coaching may be easier entry point (5,700 searches)
- Board advisory as premium positioning if that attracts better clients

### Risk 3: Implementation Takes Longer Than 30 Days

**Mitigation**:
- Deploy agents to work in parallel
- Focus on homepage FIRST (80% of traffic)
- Service pages can roll out incrementally
- SEO is long-term game (don't rush technical implementation)

**Fallback**:
- Launch homepage in Week 2, add service pages in Week 3-4
- Prioritize strategic consulting, executive coaching, business coaching pages
- Board advisory and wellbeing can come later

### Risk 4: Website Generates Inquiries But Wrong Clients

**Mitigation**:
- Track inquiry sources (which keywords, which pages)
- Qualify leads with assessment forms
- Add pricing/investment ranges to filter unqualified
- Adjust messaging based on inquiry quality

**Fallback**:
- If too many low-value business coaching inquiries, reduce prominence
- If strategic consulting attracts right clients, double down
- If board advisory inquiries are highest quality, elevate it

---

## ‚úÖ DECISION POINTS

### Decision 1: Primary Positioning

**Recommendation**: "Strategic Consultant | Executive Coach | Board Advisor"

**Alternatives**:
- A) "Executive Coach & Strategic Consultant" (coaching-first)
- B) "Strategic Consultant & Board Advisor" (consulting + board focus)
- C) "Business Coach & Strategic Advisor" (broader market appeal)

**We recommend**: Original option (balanced, targets 12,130 buyer searches)

### Decision 2: Service Page Priority

**Recommendation**: Create all 5 service pages in Week 2

**Alternative**: Launch with 3 primary pages first (strategic, executive coaching, business coaching)

**We recommend**: All 5 pages (comprehensive, shows range, supports SEO)

### Decision 3: Wellbeing Positioning

**Recommendation**: Position wellbeing as "Premium Differentiator" not primary service

**Alternative**: Keep wellbeing more prominent (hybrid approach)

**We recommend**: Differentiator (data supports this - only 1,000 searches vs 12,130 total)

### Decision 4: Navigation Hierarchy

**Recommendation**:
1. Strategic Consulting
2. Executive Coaching
3. Business Coaching
4. Board Advisory
5. Wellbeing Governance

**Alternative**: Services dropdown with alphabetical order

**We recommend**: Prioritized order (guides buyers to highest-volume services)
