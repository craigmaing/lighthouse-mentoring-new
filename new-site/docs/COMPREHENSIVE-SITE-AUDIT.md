# üîç COMPREHENSIVE SITE AUDIT - LIGHTHOUSE MENTORING
**Before NED-First Redesign Implementation**
*Generated: January 2025*

---

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current State**: Site is technically excellent (modern Astro build, good performance) but strategically misaligned with Craig's business goals.

**Strategic Misalignment**:
- **Current positioning**: "IoD Wellbeing Ambassador" (wellbeing-first)
- **Current revenue**: 100% wellbeing consulting from H&S word-of-mouth
- **Website inquiries**: ZERO
- **Target positioning**: Non Executive Director (NED-first)
- **Target revenue**: 40% NED/board work (currently 0%)

**Opportunity Size**:
- "non executive director" = 5,400 searches/month (LOW competition)
- "workplace wellbeing" = 1,000 searches/month (MEDIUM competition)
- Craig has globally unique credentials for NED work (IoD Ambassador + FRSPH + FCMI)

**Recommendation**: Immediate repositioning to NED-first with wellbeing as differentiator, not primary service.

## üéØ CURRENT HOMEPAGE ANALYSIS

### Hero Section (Screenshot: homepage-hero-current.png)

**Current Headline**:
> "I've spent 17 years in boardrooms. Here's what actually works."

**Current Subheadline**:
> "The only IoD Wellbeing Ambassador with FRSPH + FCMI fellowships turning workplace wellbeing into board-level strategy."

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ **What Works**:
- Strong opening ("17 years in boardrooms") establishes board-level credibility
- Emphasizes unique credentials (IoD + FRSPH + FCMI)
- "Board-level" language resonates with target audience
- Clear, confident tone

‚ùå **Strategic Problems**:
- Leads with "Wellbeing Ambassador" (niche positioning)
- Primary identity is wellbeing consultant, not NED
- Doesn't clearly state he SERVES on boards, implies he advises on wellbeing
- Missing NED positioning entirely
- No urgency or availability messaging

**SEO Analysis**:
- Title tag: "Workplace Wellbeing Consultant | Board-Level Strategy | Craig Fearn"
- Targets wellbeing searches, not NED searches
- Missing "non executive director" keyword (5,400 searches/month)

### Navigation Structure

### Social Proof

**Current Stats**:
- 100% Board Strategy Approval Rate
- 12 ISO 45003 Certifications
- 100+ Organizations Transformed

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ Good metrics, shows impact
‚ùå All wellbeing-focused, not NED-focused

### CTAs (Call-to-Actions)

**Primary CTAs**:
1. "Book Strategic Assessment"
2. "View Services"
3. "Secure Your Strategic Session"

**Analysis**:
‚úÖ Clear, action-oriented
‚ùå Generic consulting language, not NED-specific

## üí∞ BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Current Website Performance

**Traffic**: Unknown (no analytics shared)
**Inquiries**: ZERO according to Craig
**Conversions**: ZERO NED opportunities from website

**Why Zero Inquiries?**:
1. Site positions as consultant, not NED
2. No clear service for board chairs/nomination committees
3. Targeting wellbeing keywords (1,000 searches) not NED keywords (5,400 searches)
4. All clients come from H&S word-of-mouth, not website
5. No urgency or scarcity messaging

### Revenue Impact

**Current Revenue**:
- 100% wellbeing consulting
- All from word-of-mouth (H&S networks)
- Website contributes: ¬£0

**Potential Revenue with NED-First Positioning**:
- 4-5 NED positions @ ¬£35K avg = ¬£140K-¬£175K recurring
- Plus selective consulting projects = ¬£200K+
- Total potential: ¬£340K-¬£375K (vs current unknown)
