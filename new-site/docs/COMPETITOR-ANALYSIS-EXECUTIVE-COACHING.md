# EXECUTIVE COACHING COMPETITOR ANALYSIS - UK MARKET
## Research Report for Lighthouse Mentoring Website Rebuild

**Research Date:** September 30, 2025
**Focus:** C-Suite & CEO Executive Coaching Services in UK
**Objective:** Inform strategic positioning and website design for Craig's executive coaching services

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The UK executive coaching market is experiencing robust growth (12.8% CAGR), with global executive coaching projected to reach $161.10 billion by 2030. CEO and C-suite coaching commands premium pricing (£500-£2,000/hour), with strong demand driven by organizational recognition that 77% of executives report coaching significantly impacts key business metrics.

**Key Competitive Landscape Insights:**
- Market is crowded but lacks strong differentiation beyond credentials
- ICF certification is table stakes, not a differentiator
- Board-level experience is highly valued but rarely combined with practical storytelling expertise
- Most competitors focus on "soft" coaching methodologies rather than commercial outcomes
- Pricing transparency varies widely - many hide pricing, creating friction
- Strong testimonials and social proof are critical conversion elements

**Craig's Strategic Opportunity:** His unique combination of board-level P&L experience, storytelling expertise (TEDMED/SXSW), and commercial pragmatism positions him to own the "results-driven CEO coach for high-stakes communications" niche.

## POSITIONING INSIGHTS - WHAT'S WORKING IN THE MARKET

### 1. Niche Specialization Wins
**Successful Positioning:**
- Dave Bailey: Venture-backed tech CEOs exclusively
- Peter Botting: High-stakes storytelling and speaker coaching
- Nicola Simpson: Amazon interview specialist
- EQworks: Emotional intelligence focus

**Key Takeaway:** General "executive coach" positioning is commoditized. Specific niches command premium pricing and clearer client fit.

### 2. Social Proof & Credentials
**What Works:**
- Specific client names, companies, and funding/revenue amounts
- 5-star testimonial format
- Outcomes, not just feelings ("raised $30M", "doubled turnover")
- High-profile brand logos
- VC fund partnerships (for tech coaches)
- Speaking credentials (TEDMED, SXSW)

**Key Takeaway:** Vague testimonials don't convert. Specific outcomes + named clients = credibility.

### 3. Pricing Strategy Divide
**Two Successful Approaches:**

**A) Full Transparency:**
- Nicola Simpson shows all pricing upfront
- Reduces friction and builds trust
- "I could hide pricing like others... but I'd rather you knew"
- Creates differentiation through honesty

**B) Strategic Opacity:**
- Dave Bailey, Peter Botting, The Leadership Coaches hide pricing
- Requires discovery call/chemistry session
- Allows for value-based pricing conversations
- Can price discriminate based on client ability to pay

**Key Takeaway:** Both work, but transparency is rarer and could be differentiator for Craig's approachable positioning.

### 4. "Safe Yet Never Soft" Positioning
**Successful Balance:**
- The Leadership Coaches: "Feels safe, yet never soft"
- Peter Botting: "Not hired to be nice - hired to make you better"
- Dave Bailey: "Questions are more powerful than answers" + "Accountability drives results"

**Key Takeaway:** CEOs want psychological safety AND commercial challenge. "Soft" coaching doesn't resonate; results-driven with empathy does.

### 5. Process & Structure Signals Professionalism
**What Works:**
- Clear coaching journey maps (discovery → contracting → coaching → review)
- Mid-point reviews with sponsors
- Impact reporting and ROI measurement
- Triad meetings (coach/coachee/sponsor)
- Defined session counts (e.g., "7 sessions over 6-9 months")

**Key Takeaway:** CEOs want structure and accountability, not open-ended "let's see where this goes" coaching.

### 6. High-Stakes Scenarios Resonate
**Peter Botting's Winning Approach:**
- Defines specific "defining moments": C-suite transitions, IPOs, board presentations, crisis comms, layoffs
- Not generic "improve your leadership"
- "When it's a big gig. When it really matters."

**Key Takeaway:** CEOs engage coaches when stakes are high, not for general development. Positioning around critical moments is powerful.

### 7. Founder/Operator Credibility
**What Creates Trust:**
- "I've been there" messaging
- Real P&L experience, not just theory
- Turnaround stories
- Operating experience, not just coaching credentials
- Board-level roles held personally

**Key Takeaway:** CEOs don't want to be coached by career coaches. They want ex-operators who've sat in their chair.

## COMPETITIVE GAPS & CRAIG'S OPPORTUNITIES

### Gap 1: Storytelling + Strategic Coaching Integration
**Market Gap:**
- Peter Botting does storytelling/speaker coaching well
- Most others do strategic leadership coaching
- NO ONE combines board-level strategic thinking + storytelling + wellbeing holistically

**Craig's Opportunity:**
Position as "The CEO coach for leaders who need to perform in boardrooms AND on stages." Unique integration of:
- Board-level strategic advisory (Non-Exec Director experience)
- High-stakes communication (keynotes, investor pitches, all-hands)
- Human-centered leadership (wellbeing, pattern recognition)
- P&L accountability (turnaround experience)

### Gap 2: Human+AI Methodology
**Market Gap:**
- No competitors articulate a systematic methodology beyond "coaching conversations"
- Most rely on credentials and experience alone
- No one uses AI/data for pattern recognition in coaching

**Craig's Opportunity:**
- Position the wellbeing audit as a CEO self-diagnostic tool
- Use pattern recognition as differentiator ("I spot what you can't see")
- "Human wisdom + AI-enhanced insights" positioning
- Systematic approach vs. "let's talk it out"

### Gap 3: Wellbeing + Performance Integration
**Market Gap:**
- EQworks does EQ but feels "soft"
- Dave Bailey and Peter Botting are results-focused but miss wellbeing angle
- Market increasingly values mental health/stress management, but it's siloed

**Craig's Opportunity:**
- "Peak performance through wellbeing" positioning
- Not "work-life balance" platitudes, but "sustainable high performance"
- Pattern recognition catches burnout before it crashes leaders
- Appeals to modern CEOs who recognize mental health ≠ weakness

### Gap 4: "Been There" Board-Level Credibility
**Market Gap:**
- Many coaches have "coached CEOs" but haven't BEEN a CEO/board member
- Operating experience mentioned but often vague
- Turnaround experience rare

**Craig's Opportunity:**
- Specific: Non-Executive Director roles
- Specific: Turnaround experience (if applicable - needs confirmation from Craig)
- Specific: Which boards, which industries
- "I don't just coach CEOs. I sit on boards. I've been in your seat."

### Gap 5: Transparent, Flexible Pricing
**Market Gap:**
- Most hide pricing
- Nicola Simpson is exception but positioned more junior
- No premium coach offering transparent pricing

**Craig's Opportunity:**
- "CEO-level coaching with founder-friendly transparency"
- Show pricing ranges or typical packages
- "No discovery call sales pitch - let's have a real conversation"
- Differentiates from "enterprise coaching firms"

### Gap 6: Founder/CEO-Specific vs. General Executive
**Market Gap:**
- Dave Bailey owns venture-backed CEO space
- But what about traditional industry CEOs?
- What about CEO transitions (2nd-time CEOs, corporate to startup)?
- What about Non-Exec Directors coaching CEOs?

**Craig's Opportunity:**
- "CEO coaching from a board perspective"
- Position for CEOs who report to boards (not just founders)
- "Your board wants you to succeed. I help you meet—and exceed—their expectations."

## DESIGN & UX BEST PRACTICES FROM COMPETITORS

### What Works Visually:

**1. Hero Sections:**
- Clear value proposition above the fold
- Specific target audience named ("venture-backed CEOs", "C-suite executives")
- Strong CTA ("Enquire Now", "Book Chemistry Call")
- Professional headshot or personal brand photo

**2. Social Proof Placement:**
- Client logos prominently near top (Dave Bailey: VC funds, Peter Botting: major brands)
- 5-star rating visuals
- Specific testimonials with names, companies, outcomes
- Video testimonials (Dave Bailey)

**3. Credentials Section:**
- Bullet-pointed achievements
- Specific numbers (32,107 hours, 300+ speakers, 400% ROI)
- Mix of coaching credentials + operating experience
- "What makes us different" section

**4. Process/Journey Map:**
- Visual representation of coaching journey
- Clear steps: Discovery → Coaching → Review → Impact
- Timeline indicators (6-9 months, 7 sessions, etc.)

**5. FAQ Sections:**
- Address common objections ("Why do I need a coach if I have board members?")
- Build trust ("Is coaching confidential?")
- Set expectations ("How much does it cost?", "Will I see ROI?")

**6. Specific Use Cases:**
- Peter Botting does this brilliantly
- "When to hire me" scenarios
- Makes it easy for prospect to self-identify

**7. CTAs:**
- Multiple throughout page, not just bottom
- Low-friction: "Book a call" vs. "Sign up now"
- Time-bound: "Don't put it off - this may be the most important decision you make this quarter"

### What Doesn't Work:

**1. Generic "Leadership Development" Messaging:**
- Cambria Consulting feels corporate and impersonal
- No differentiation from competitors

**2. Text-Heavy Pages:**
- Peter Botting's site has great content but overwhelming amount of text
- Nicola Simpson's pricing page is too long
- Needs better visual hierarchy and scanning

**3. Hidden Pricing With No Context:**
- Creates friction when NO indication given
- At least say "Typical packages range from £X-£Y" or "Investment starts at £X"

**4. Team Approach Without Personal Connection:**
- Coachable and The Leadership Coaches have teams
- Harder to build personal brand/connection
- Works for corporate buyers, less for individual CEOs

**5. Vague Testimonials:**
- "John was great to work with" = useless
- Need specific outcomes and attribution

## MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### Primary Message:
"Most executive coaches have never sat in your chair. I have. As a Non-Executive Director and board advisor with 30+ years of operating experience, I bring strategic advisory + executive coaching to CEOs navigating their highest-stakes moments."

### Supporting Messages:

**On Board Experience:**
"I don't just coach CEOs—I advise boards and sit in board meetings. I understand the strategic complexity, stakeholder dynamics, and high expectations you're navigating. This perspective changes everything."

**On Storytelling/Communication:**
"Your strategy is only as good as your ability to communicate it. Whether you're pitching investors, presenting to the board, keynoting a conference, or leading through crisis, I help you craft and deliver messages that move people."

**On Pattern Recognition:**
"Most leaders can't see their own patterns. As your coach, I spot the recurring dynamics, blind spots, and opportunities you're too close to see. This pattern recognition—enhanced by wellbeing data—gives you the edge."

**On Wellbeing + Performance:**
"Peak performance isn't about pushing harder. It's about sustainable excellence. My wellbeing audit and pulse monitoring catch burnout before it crashes you, so you can lead at your best for the long term."

**On "Been There, Done That":**
"I've held P&L responsibility, navigated turnarounds, and made the tough calls that keep CEOs up at night. This isn't theory—it's hard-won wisdom from the trenches."

### Objection Handling:

**"I already have a board/advisors. Why do I need a coach?"**
"Your board holds you accountable. Your coach helps you prepare to meet—and exceed—their expectations. Think of me as your strategic thinking partner in between board meetings, helping you refine your decisions, sharpen your communication, and optimize your performance before you walk into that boardroom."

**"How is this different from other executive coaching?"**
"Three ways: (1) I bring board-level strategic perspective, not just coaching questions. (2) I specialize in high-stakes communication—keynotes, investor pitches, board presentations—not just leadership development. (3) I use pattern recognition and wellbeing data to give you insights you can't see on your own."

**"What's the ROI?"**
"My clients report clearer strategic thinking, better stakeholder communication, faster decision-making, and sustained performance without burnout. Specific outcomes include successful fundraises, seamless CEO transitions, keynotes that generated business impact, and board meetings where they felt fully prepared and confident. If you're making million-pound decisions, the ROI of clarity is exponential."

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR WEBSITE REBUILD

### 1. **Niche Specificity = Premium Positioning**
Don't be "executive coach for leaders." Be "CEO coach for high-stakes leadership moments from board perspective."

### 2. **Credentials + Operating Experience = Trust**
ICF certification is table stakes. Board-level P&L experience is the differentiator.

### 3. **Storytelling/Communication is Underserved**
Peter Botting proves the market exists. Craig can own "CEO coach for leaders who need to perform in boardrooms AND on stages."

### 4. **Social Proof Must Be Specific**
No vague testimonials. Names + Companies + Specific Outcomes = Credibility.

### 5. **Pricing Transparency = Differentiation Opportunity**
Most hide pricing. Craig can stand out by showing ranges and building trust through transparency.

### 6. **Pattern Recognition is Unique**
No competitor articulates a systematic methodology like Craig's wellbeing audit + pattern recognition approach.

### 7. **"Safe Yet Never Soft" Resonates**
CEOs want empathy + accountability. Position as "human-centered" but "results-driven."

### 8. **High-Stakes Scenarios Drive Engagement**
Don't wait for general "I should probably get a coach someday." Position for urgent moments: IPO, crisis, transition, big presentation.

### 9. **Process = Professionalism**
Show clear coaching journey, session structures, review points. CEOs want structure, not ambiguity.

### 10. **Personal Brand > Firm Brand for Premium Coaching**
Dave Bailey and Peter Botting win because of personal brand. Craig should build his, not hide behind "Lighthouse Mentoring" corporate identity.
