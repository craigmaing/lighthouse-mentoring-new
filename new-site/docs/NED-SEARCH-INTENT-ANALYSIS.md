## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

**Educational Content Dominators**:
- Wikipedia, IOD, Corporate Governance Institute
- British Business Bank, Development Bank Wales
- These target LEARNING, not HIRING

**Job Boards**:
- Reed.co.uk, Indeed, Jobsite
- Targeting executives seeking NED roles

**Recruitment Agencies** (buried deeper):
- Executive search firms targeting "non executive director recruitment"
- Much lower search volumes but HIGHER buyer intent

### Where Are the Service Providers?

Searching for actual buyer keywords reveals:
- **"non executive director recruitment"** (140/month) - recruitment agencies rank
- **"appoint non executive director"** (50/month) - advisory firms rank
- These have MUCH lower volume but are TRUE buyer searches

## INTENT PERCENTAGE BREAKDOWN

Based on SERP analysis, related keywords, and ranking content:

| Search Intent | % of Traffic | User Type | Commercial Value |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Job Seekers** | 40-50% | Executives looking for NED roles | LOW (not buyers) |
| **Educational** | 30-40% | People learning about NEDs | LOW (students, early research) |
| **Buyer Intent** | 10-15% | Companies/boards looking to hire | HIGH (Craig's target) |
| **Career Advice** | 5-10% | Professionals considering NED path | LOW (not buyers) |

**ONLY 10-15% of searches are potential buyers**

That means of 5,400 monthly searches:
- **540-810 searches** = Potential buyers (companies)
- **4,600-4,860 searches** = Job seekers and learners (NOT buyers)

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS FOR LIGHTHOUSE MENTORING

### Current Strategy Problem:
You're optimizing for "non executive director" thinking it's a high-volume buyer keyword.

**Reality**:
- 85-90% of that traffic is **NOT your target market**
- You're competing with Wikipedia and job boards
- The search intent doesn't match Craig's service offering

### What Should Change:

#### 1. PIVOT TO BUYER-INTENT KEYWORDS

Instead of targeting "non executive director" (5,400/month, 85% wrong audience), target:

**HIGH BUYER INTENT (Lower Volume but RIGHT Audience)**:
- "non executive director recruitment" (140/month) - CPC £5.08
- "appoint non executive director" (50/month) - CPC £1.52
- "hire non executive director" (<10/month) - HIGH intent
- "find non executive director" (<10/month) - HIGH intent
- "need non executive director" (<10/month) - HIGHEST intent

**BETTER LONG-TAIL KEYWORDS**:
- "how to find a non executive director" (informational but buyer-focused)
- "appointing a non executive director to your board"
- "benefits of appointing a non executive director" (buyer education)
- "non executive director for [industry]" (specific buyer searches)

#### 2. REFRAME CONTENT STRATEGY

**Instead of**: "What is a Non Executive Director?" (competing with Wikipedia)

**Create**:
- "How to Find the Right Non-Executive Director for Your Board"
- "When Does Your Company Need a Non-Executive Director?"
- "The 5 Critical Mistakes When Hiring a Non-Executive Director"
- "Non-Executive Director vs Board Advisor: Which Does Your Business Need?"

These target BUYERS, not job seekers.

#### 3. SEPARATE SERVICE PAGES BY INTENT

**For Buyers** (your target):
- Page: "Non-Executive Director Recruitment Services"
- URL: `/services/non-executive-director-recruitment`
- Target: Companies looking to hire

**For NEDs** (networking/brand building):
- Page: "Become a More Effective Non-Executive Director"
- URL: `/resources/non-executive-director-development`
- Target: Executives in NED roles (potential referral sources)

## ALTERNATIVE POSITIONING STRATEGY

### Instead of Leading with "Non-Executive Director"...

Consider these buyer-focused angles:

1. **"Board Advisory Services"**
   - Broader appeal
   - Includes NED, board consulting, governance
   - Less job-seeker confusion

2. **"Executive Board Consulting"**
   - Service-focused, not role-focused
   - Clearer buyer intent

3. **"Fractional Board Leadership"**
   - Modern terminology
   - Differentiates from full-time NED roles

4. **"Strategic Board Advisory"**
   - Premium positioning
   - Emphasizes value over role title

---

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

### Who's Winning BUYER Keywords:

**For "non executive director recruitment"**:
1. Executive search firms (Spencer Stuart, Odgers Berndtson)
2. Specialist NED recruitment agencies
3. Governance institutes

**For "board advisory"**:
- Management consultancies
- Boutique advisory firms
- Individual consultants

**Key Insight**: Fewer competitors for buyer keywords = easier to rank

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### 1. VALIDATE "BOARD ADVISORY" KEYWORD
Run same analysis for:
- "board advisory"
- "board advisor"
- "board consultant"
- "board consulting"

These might have BETTER buyer intent than "non executive director"

### 2. CREATE BUYER-FOCUSED CONTENT
Shift homepage and service pages from:
- Explaining WHAT a NED is (educational)

To:
- Explaining WHY a company needs one (buyer problem)
- HOW to find the right one (buyer solution)
- WHEN to bring one in (buyer timing)

### 3. SECONDARY POSITIONING FOR JOB SEEKERS
Don't ignore the 5,400 monthly searches entirely:
- Create a "Resources for NEDs" section
- Position as thought leadership
- Capture emails for network building
- These NEDs can become referral sources

But DON'T make this the primary focus.

---

## FINAL VERDICT

### Is "Non Executive Director" a BUYER keyword?

**NO** - It's primarily a JOB SEEKER and EDUCATIONAL keyword.

### Should Craig target it?

**SECONDARY TARGET ONLY** - For brand awareness and thought leadership, not lead generation.

### What should be the primary SEO focus?

**BUYER-INTENT KEYWORDS** with lower volume but higher conversion:
- "board advisory" (to be analyzed)
- "non executive director recruitment"
- "appoint non executive director"
- "[industry] + board advisor"

### Estimated Impact:

**Current Strategy** (targeting "non executive director"):
- 5,400 monthly searches
- 10-15% buyer intent = 540-810 potential buyers
- High competition with Wikipedia, job boards
- Low conversion rate (wrong audience)

**Revised Strategy** (targeting buyer keywords):
- 300-500 monthly searches (combined)
- 70-90% buyer intent = 210-450 potential buyers
- Lower competition
- HIGH conversion rate (right audience)

**Result**: Lower traffic, HIGHER quality leads, BETTER conversion.

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **URGENT**: Analyze search intent for "board advisory" and "board advisor"
2. Audit current homepage - does it speak to buyers or job seekers?
3. Rewrite service pages with buyer-focused messaging
4. Create content targeting buyer-intent keywords
5. Build separate resource hub for NEDs (referral network)
6. Monitor conversion rates from different keyword sources

---

## CONCLUSION

The "non executive director" keyword appears attractive due to high volume (5,400/month), but **85-90% of this traffic is NOT your target market**.

**Strategic Recommendation**: PIVOT to lower-volume, higher-intent buyer keywords. Better to rank #1 for "appoint non executive director" (50/month, high buyer intent) than #10 for "non executive director" (5,400/month, 85% wrong audience).

**This changes everything about the SEO strategy.**
