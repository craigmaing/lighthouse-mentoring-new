### FAQ Section

**Q: How is board advisory different from management consulting?**
A: Board advisory focuses specifically on governance, board dynamics, and director-level decision-making. It's about helping boards be more effective, not operational improvements. Craig has sat in your chair—he's not bringing theory but lived experience.

**Q: Do you attend board meetings?**
A: This can be arranged if valuable. Some engagements involve observation of board meetings to understand dynamics. Others are purely advisory—regular sessions outside board meetings. We tailor to your needs.

**Q: What if the issues are confidential or politically sensitive?**
A: All board advisory work is strictly confidential. Craig is bound by professional codes of conduct and has experience navigating sensitive situations. Discretion and trust are foundational.

**Q: How long do board advisory engagements typically last?**
A: It varies significantly. Some are short-term (3-6 months) to address a specific challenge. Others are ongoing relationships (1-2 years) supporting continuous improvement. We agree scope upfront and review regularly.

**Q: What's the investment for board advisory services?**
A: Fees depend on scope, frequency, and complexity. Following an initial consultation, Craig provides a clear proposal. Board advisory is a significant investment, but governance failures are far more costly.

**Q: Do you work with small organizations or just large corporations?**
A: Craig works with organizations of all sizes. What matters is commitment to governance excellence. Small and medium organizations often benefit most from experienced board advisory.

**Q: Can you help with board recruitment or succession planning?**
A: Yes. Craig provides guidance on board composition, skills matrices, NED recruitment, and succession planning. He doesn't recruit directly but can guide the process and evaluate candidates if needed.

### FAQ Section

**Q: How is executive coaching different from mentoring?**
A: Coaching focuses on helping you find your own answers through structured exploration and challenge. Mentoring is more directive—sharing experience and advice. Craig combines both: professional coaching methodology with the ability to share board-level insight when valuable.

**Q: How long does executive coaching take?**
A: Most executive coaching engagements run 6-12 months with monthly or fortnightly sessions. Some focus on specific transitions (3-6 months), others are ongoing development relationships (12+ months). We review regularly and adjust as needed.

**Q: What happens in a coaching session?**
A: Sessions are confidential, challenging conversations about your real leadership challenges. We explore what's working, what's not, what you want to achieve, and what's holding you back. Between sessions, you experiment with new approaches. It's action-focused, not theoretical.

**Q: Is coaching confidential?**
A: Absolutely. What you discuss remains confidential (except in exceptional circumstances required by law). Craig is bound by EMCC code of ethics. Many clients don't tell their organizations they're being coached—it's entirely your choice.

**Q: Do you offer group or team coaching?**
A: Yes. Craig works with executive teams on collective effectiveness. This is different from 1:1 coaching but equally powerful for leadership team alignment and performance.

**Q: What's the investment in executive coaching?**
A: Executive coaching is a professional development investment. Fees depend on session frequency and engagement length. Following an initial consultation, Craig provides a clear proposal. Many organizations sponsor coaching for their senior leaders.

**Q: How do we measure coaching success?**
A: We define specific, measurable goals at the start. Progress is reviewed regularly through self-assessment, feedback from stakeholders, and tangible outcomes (promotions, successful projects, improved relationships). Most clients report significant leadership growth.

### FAQ Section

**Q: How is this different from a traditional engagement survey?**
A: Traditional surveys give you scores—wellbeing audits give you strategic insight. We combine multiple data sources, use AI pattern recognition, and apply FRSPH Fellowship-level expertise to understand the "why" behind the numbers. You get actionable recommendations, not just data.

**Q: What data sources do you analyze?**
A: We work with whatever data you have: engagement surveys, HR metrics (turnover, absence), performance data, 360 feedback, exit interviews, cultural assessments, etc. The more diverse the data, the richer the insights. We can also gather new data if needed.

**Q: How does the AI analysis work?**
A: AI pattern recognition identifies connections and themes across multiple data sources that humans might miss. However, AI doesn't replace human insight—Craig interprets patterns within organizational context, applies wellbeing expertise, and develops strategic recommendations.

**Q: Is our data kept confidential?**
A: Absolutely. All data is handled with strict confidentiality. Reports are anonymized appropriately. Craig is bound by professional codes of conduct. Data security and privacy are paramount.

**Q: What size organization is this suitable for?**
A: Wellbeing audits work for organizations of all sizes—from 50 employees to 5,000+. The approach scales. Smaller organizations often get more personalized insight; larger ones benefit from pattern recognition across divisions or functions.

**Q: What happens after the audit?**
A: You receive a comprehensive report and recommendations. Implementation is up to you, though Craig can provide ongoing advisory support if valuable. Some organizations engage Craig to support implementation; others take recommendations and run with them.

**Q: What's the investment for a wellbeing audit?**
A: Fees depend on organization size, data complexity, and scope. Following initial consultation, Craig provides a clear proposal. Wellbeing audits are a strategic investment—the cost of poor wellbeing (turnover, absence, low productivity) is far higher.
