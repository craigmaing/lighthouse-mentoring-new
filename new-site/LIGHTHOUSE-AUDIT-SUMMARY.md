## 🔴 Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Performance - Slow Load Times
**Impact:** Users experience delays before content becomes interactive

**Issues:**
- ⏱️ **Time to Interactive: 10.0 seconds** (Target: < 3.8s)
- ⏱️ **First Contentful Paint: 3.8 seconds** (Target: < 1.8s)
- ⏱️ **Largest Contentful Paint: 3.9 seconds** (Target: < 2.5s)

**Why This Matters:**
- Board-level executives expect fast, professional experiences
- Google uses LCP as a ranking factor
- Slow load times increase bounce rates

**Root Causes:**
1. **Development server** - Running on localhost dev server (not optimized production build)
2. **Unused CSS** - 21KB of unused CSS being loaded
3. **Unoptimized assets** - Dev server doesn't have production optimizations

### 2. Accessibility - Color Contrast Issue
**Impact:** Some text may be difficult to read for users with visual impairments

**Issue:**
- 🎨 **Color Contrast Failure** - Background and foreground colors lack sufficient contrast ratio

**WCAG Requirements:**
- Normal text: 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- Large text (18pt+): 3:1 contrast ratio minimum

**Likely Culprits:**
- Secondary button text on eggshell background
- Light gray text on eggshell/white backgrounds
- Badge text colors

### 3. SEO - Non-Descriptive Link Text
**Impact:** Screen readers and search engines can't understand link context

**Issue:**
- 🔗 **Links without descriptive text** - Some links use generic text like "Learn More" or "Click Here"

**Examples to Fix:**
- "Learn More" → "Learn More About Board Advisory Services"
- "Get Started" → "Book a Strategic Consultation"
- "Email Craig" → Already descriptive ✅

---

## 🟡 Performance Opportunities

### Reduce Unused CSS
- **Potential Savings:** 21 KiB
- **Impact:** Faster initial page load
- **Solution:**
  - Remove unused Tailwind CSS classes
  - Use PurgeCSS in production build
  - Already configured in Tailwind, just needs production build

### Development vs Production
**Current Test Environment:**
- Running on Vite dev server (port 2131)
- No minification
- No tree-shaking
- No asset optimization
- Source maps included

**Production Build Will Provide:**
- Minified CSS/JS
- Tree-shaking to remove unused code
- Optimized images (already using AVIF/WebP)
- Gzip/Brotli compression
- CDN caching (when deployed)

---

## 🟢 What's Working Excellently

### Best Practices: 100/100 ✅
- No console errors
- HTTPS ready (when deployed)
- No security vulnerabilities detected
- Proper image aspect ratios
- No deprecated APIs

### Accessibility: 96/100 ✅
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy

- Keyboard navigation support
- Skip-to-content link
- Focus states defined

### SEO: 92/100 ✅
- Meta descriptions present
- Mobile-friendly viewport
- Crawlable content
- robots.txt configured
- Proper heading structure
- Fast server response times

### Layout Stability: Perfect ✅
- **Cumulative Layout Shift: 0** - No unexpected layout shifts
- Images have proper dimensions
- Fonts load without FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)

## 📋 Action Plan - Priority Order

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Before Launch)

1. **Build Production Version**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx serve dist/  # Or deploy to Netlify/Vercel
   ```
   - Expected improvements:
     - Performance: 79 → 90+
     - FCP: 3.8s → < 2s
     - LCP: 3.9s → < 2.5s
     - CSS savings from purging unused styles

2. **Fix Color Contrast Issues**
   - Audit all text/background combinations
   - Test with contrast checker: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
   - Likely fixes:
     - Increase text color darkness on light backgrounds
     - Adjust badge text colors
     - Review secondary button contrast

3. **Add Descriptive Link Text**
   - Review all links site-wide
   - Add context to generic "Learn More" links
   - Use `aria-label` for icon-only links
   - Examples:
     ```html
     <!-- Before -->
     <a href="/services">Learn More</a>

     <!-- After -->
     <a href="/services">Learn More About Our Services</a>
     ```

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Post-Launch)

4. **Optimize Font Loading**
   - Already using Inter Variable ✅
   - Verify `font-display: swap` is configured
   - Consider preloading critical fonts
   ```html
   <link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
   ```

5. **Implement Resource Hints**
   ```html
   <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
   <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" crossorigin>
   ```

6. **Add Structured Data**
   - Organization schema
   - Person schema (Craig Fearn)
   - ProfessionalService schema for each service

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

7. **Advanced Performance**
   - Implement service worker for offline support
   - Add critical CSS inline for above-fold content
   - Lazy load below-fold images (may already be configured)

8. **Analytics & Monitoring**
   - Set up Real User Monitoring (RUM)
   - Track Core Web Vitals in production
   - Monitor performance over time
