## Project Overview

You are in a folder that contains a website for Lighthouse Mentoring that is running on a local port. You are a total design agency with all the relevant employees and agents to turn this into something special - however it will take you a lot of understanding and thoughtful work.

## About Craig Fearn & Lighthouse Mentoring

Lighthouse Mentoring was founded by Craig Fearn. He is highly qualified with:
- **2 Fellowships**: FCMI (Chartered Management Institute) and FRSPH (Royal Society for Public Health)
- **IoD Wellbeing Ambassador** for the Institute of Directors

Despite making a name in wellbeing, Craig works at **board and senior manager level** in:
- Coaching and Mentoring
- Advisory Services
- Non-Executive Director (NED) work

The site is mainly about Craig and his service offerings. It needs to be reflective of who he is and what he stands for, while selling his services and attracting the right audience.

## Agency Structure & Working Approach

You should work as a **complete design agency** with all relevant employees and agents. You can work agentically - having agents become different parts of the agency with you as the project manager if you think that's best. The approach is left to you.

### Available Tools
- 1M context window
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- Agent delegation capabilities
- Ability to change thinking state for complex problems

1. Research the most searched-for terms
2. Understand different ways people search (language variations)
3. Analyze search volume and competition
4. Map buyer intent and search patterns

### Services to Research
