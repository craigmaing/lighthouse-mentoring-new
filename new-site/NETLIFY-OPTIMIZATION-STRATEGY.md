### 4. Environment Variables (Security Best Practice)
**Current**: Credentials in `.mcp.json` (development only)
**Needed**: Secure production credentials

**Setup**:
```bash
# Set environment variables for production
netlify env:set DATAFORSEO_USERNAME "your-username"

netlify env:set CONTACT_EMAIL "craig.fearn@lighthousementoring.co.uk"
```

**Benefits**:

## üöÄ Medium-Priority Optimizations

### 5. Enhanced Security Headers
**Current Status**: Basic headers in `public/_headers`

**Recommended `_headers` file**:
```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()

# Cache static assets
/images/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

/_astro/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

# Don't cache HTML pages (for fresh content)
/*.html
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate
```

**Benefits**:
- Better SEO (Google likes secure sites)
- Faster repeat visits (aggressive caching)
- Protection against common attacks

---

### 6. Redirects & URL Optimization
**Setup**: Create `public/_redirects`

**Use Cases**:

#### a) Clean URLs
```
/services/board-advisory.html  /services/board-advisory  301
/contact.html                  /contact                  301
```

#### b) SEO-Friendly Redirects
```
# Redirect old URLs if site previously existed
/old-contact-page  /contact  301
```

#### c) Service Shortcuts
```
/coaching      /services/executive-coaching      302
/board         /services/board-advisory          302
/wellbeing     /services/organizational-wellbeing 302
