# Deployment Trigger

Timestamp: 2025-10-22 - Force Netlify rebuild

This file exists solely to trigger a fresh Netlify deployment after cache clear.

## Issue
The /resources/ page is still serving old blue gradient version despite:
- File deleted locally (resources.astro)
- Commit pushed (9d22ac9)
- Netlify cache cleared by user

## Expected Result
After this commit, /resources/ should return 404 since the file no longer exists.

## Deployment Status
- Commit: 9d22ac9 "Remove blue resources page and legacy files"
- Files deleted: resources.astro + 11 legacy files
- Expected: 25 pages generated (resources.astro should not exist)
