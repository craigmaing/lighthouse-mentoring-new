2. **Executive/Leadership Coaching** combines for strong volume (2,200/mo) with manageable competition
3. **Management Consulting** offers substantial opportunity (2,900/mo) using transformation/change terminology
4. **Wellbeing Consulting** is smaller (1,000/mo) but has unique audit opportunity and high-value corporate buyers
5. **Board Advisory** requires careful keyword selection (330/mo) - avoid job seeker terms

### Critical Strategic Insights:
