## PART 1: EXISTING ASSET AUDIT

### 1.1 PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY ASSETS

#### **TIER A: PREMIUM PROFESSIONAL PORTRAITS**

| File | Dimensions | Size | Quality Assessment | Current Use | Recommendation |
|------|-----------|------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `craig-headshot.jpg` | 2171x3000 | 2.4MB | Excellent - Sharp, professional, neutral background | Contact page | **OPTIMIZE & PROMOTE** - Primary headshot for About page, testimonials, contact. Resize to 800x1105px max, WebP format |
| `craig-portrait-8372.jpg` | 2055x3000 | 3.3MB | Excellent - Confident pose, professional attire | Not currently used | **STRATEGIC RESERVE** - Alternative hero option, LinkedIn graphics. Resize to multiple sizes |

**Strategic Value:** These are Craig's most authentic personal brand assets. Both convey authority, approachability, and professional gravitas.

**Optimization Required:**
```
craig-headshot.jpg â†’ craig-headshot-800w.webp (50-80KB)
craig-headshot.jpg â†’ craig-headshot-400w.webp (25-40KB)
craig-portrait-8372.jpg â†’ craig-portrait-600w.webp (40-60KB)
```

---

#### **TIER B: BOARDROOM SETTING PHOTOGRAPHY**

| File | Dimensions | Size | Quality | Context | Strategic Use |
|------|-----------|------|---------|---------|---------------|
| `10 LIZ_7493.jpg` | 1997x3000 | 3.5MB | Excellent | Craig in boardroom, standing confidently | Board advisory pages, NED service imagery |
| `18 LIZ_7498.jpg` | 1997x3000 | 3.2MB | Excellent | Craig seated, professional setting | Executive coaching hero, about page |
| `9 LIZ_7481 09.43.39.jpg` | 1997x3000 | 3.6MB | Excellent | Alternative boardroom pose | Service pages, testimonial sections |
| `executive-coaching-7490.jpg` | 1997x3000 | 3.1MB | Excellent | Professional coaching environment | Currently used in executive coaching service page |
| `executive-success-7516.jpg` | 1997x3000 | 3.1MB | Excellent | Success-oriented professional shot | Business consultant page |

**Strategic Assessment:**
- All 5 images are exceptionally high quality (Nikon Df/D800, professional lighting)
- Consistent color palette (navy blues, neutral grays)
- Professional environment reinforces board-level positioning
- Current file sizes are 10-15x larger than web-optimal

**Critical Action:** These images MUST be resized and converted to WebP format immediately. They're currently destroying page load performance.

**Recommended Optimization Pipeline:**
```bash
For each image:
- Desktop hero: 1920px width, WebP, quality 85 = 150-250KB
- Tablet: 1024px width, WebP, quality 80 = 80-120KB
- Mobile: 768px width, WebP, quality 75 = 50-80KB
- Thumbnail: 400px width, WebP, quality 70 = 25-40KB
```

**Projected savings:** 15.3MB â†’ 2-3MB (80-85% reduction)

---

#### **TIER C: IOD CONFERENCE PHOTOGRAPHY**

| File | Dimensions | Size | Quality | Context | Strategic Value |
|------|-----------|------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `iod-conference-07.jpg` | 3400x2267 | 7.0MB | Excellent | IoD aerospace conference, Craig speaking | Currently used as hero background - CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION NEEDED |
| `iod-conference-142.jpg` | 3400x2267 | 7.5MB | Excellent | Conference presentation scene | Contact page background |
| `iod-conference-83.jpg` | 3400x2267 | 7.5MB | Excellent | Professional conference setting | Homepage hero background (CURRENT) |
| `iod-conference-aerospace-7.jpg` | 3400x2267 | 7.0MB | Excellent | Craig at aerospace conference | Board advisory page |
| `iod-conference-aerospace-142.jpg` | 3400x2267 | 7.5MB | Excellent | Alternative aerospace conference | Board advisory page |

**Strategic Assessment:**
- **SEVERE PERFORMANCE CRISIS:** These 5 images total 36.5MB
- Currently used as full-screen hero backgrounds on multiple pages
- Excellent for establishing authority and credibility
- Show Craig in authentic professional environments
- Reinforce IoD Ambassador status

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
```
Priority 1: Homepage Hero (iod-conference-83.jpg)
- Current: 7.5MB
- Target: 200KB (97.3% reduction)
- Impact: 7.3MB saved on every page load

Process:
1. Crop to 16:9 aspect ratio (3400x1912px)
2. Resize to 1920x1080px for desktop
3. Convert to WebP format, quality 85
4. Create responsive variants:
   - 3840x2160 (retina desktop): 400KB
   - 1920x1080 (desktop): 200KB
   - 1366x768 (laptop): 120KB
   - 768x432 (mobile): 60KB
```

**Projected savings:** 36.5MB â†’ 3-4MB (89% reduction across all conference photos)

---

### 1.2 CREDENTIAL BADGES (OPTIMAL)

| File | Dimensions | Size | Format | Status |
|------|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| `IoD-Ambassador-badge-web.png` | N/A | 92KB | PNG | âœ“ Optimized |
| `iod-global-award-badge.png` | N/A | 34KB | PNG | âœ“ Optimized |
| `iod-aspiring-award-badge.png` | N/A | 34KB | PNG | âœ“ Optimized |
| `iod-aspiring-badge.png` | N/A | 34KB | PNG | âœ“ Duplicate - consider removing |
| `iod-global-badge.png` | N/A | 34KB | PNG | âœ“ Duplicate - consider removing |
| `RSPH-Fellow-Badge.jpg` | 300x152 | 23KB | JPG | âœ“ Optimized |
| `lighthouse-mentoring-logo.png` | N/A | 30KB | PNG | âœ“ Optimized |
| `Global (1).png` | N/A | 34KB | PNG | âœ“ Optimized |

**Assessment:** Badge optimization is excellent. These are appropriate file sizes for PNG graphics with transparency.

**Recommendation:** Consolidate duplicates. Remove either `iod-aspiring-badge.png` or `iod-aspiring-award-badge.png` (keep award version). Remove either `iod-global-badge.png` or `iod-global-award-badge.png` (keep award version).

**Savings:** 68KB (minimal but good housekeeping)

---

### 1.3 AI-GENERATED IMAGES (PROBLEM ZONE)

| File | Size | Status | Issue |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| `Gemini_Generated_Image_3y7e6t3y7e6t3y7e.png` | 1.8MB | ðŸ”´ Remove | AI-generated, lacks authenticity, oversized |
| `Gemini_Generated_Image_4u3egw4u3egw4u3e (1).png` | 5.3MB | ðŸ”´ Remove | Extremely oversized, AI-generated |
| `Gemini_Generated_Image_59leph59leph59le.png` | 4.9MB | ðŸ”´ Remove | Extremely oversized, AI-generated |
| `Gemini_Generated_Image_5xdict5xdict5xdi.png` | 5.4MB | ðŸ”´ Remove | Used on pulse-monitoring page, replace with authentic photo |
| `Gemini_Generated_Image_8egcmm8egcmm8egc.png` | 1.3MB | ðŸ”´ Remove | AI-generated, lacks credibility |
| `Gemini_Generated_Image_bedcy9bedcy9bedc.png` | 5.7MB | ðŸ”´ Remove | Extremely oversized |
| `Gemini_Generated_Image_ei9effei9effei9e.png` | 6.0MB | ðŸ”´ Remove | Largest file in directory |

| `Gemini_Generated_Image_psq4mfpsq4mfpsq4 (4).png` | 4.5MB | ðŸ”´ Remove | Duplicate |

**Total AI image bloat:** 48.5MB (41% of entire images directory)

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Authenticity crisis:** AI-generated images undermine Craig's credibility as a real consultant with real experience
2. **Performance disaster:** 48.5MB of completely unnecessary data
3. **Brand damage:** Generic AI imagery contradicts the "human + AI" positioning
4. **SEO impact:** Search engines can identify AI-generated content and may penalize

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Delete all Gemini-generated images. Replace with authentic photography or high-quality professional stock that shows real people in real professional settings.

---

### 1.4 AUDIT SCREENSHOTS (INTERNAL USE)

| File | Size | Purpose | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|

**Total:** 9.6MB of internal documentation in public assets folder

**Action:** Move these to `C:\Users\Fearn\New folder (4)\docs\audits\` or delete if no longer needed. They should not be in the public images directory.

---

## PART 2: VISUAL CONTENT GAP ANALYSIS

### 2.1 MISSING CRITICAL ASSETS

#### **HOMEPAGE GAPS**

| Section | Current State | What's Needed | Priority |
|---------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Hero Section** | Using iod-conference-83.jpg (7.5MB) | Optimized WebP version at multiple breakpoints | ðŸ”´ CRITICAL |
| **Why Section** | No supporting imagery | Abstract icons or minimal graphics (trust, expertise, results) | ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM |
| **Problem Section** | Text-only | Conceptual illustration or infographic showing board challenges | ðŸŸ¢ LOW |
| **Methodology** | Text-only | Process diagram, AI + human visual metaphor | ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM |
| **Testimonials** | No client photos (intentional for confidentiality) | Generic professional headshot silhouettes or company logos (if permitted) | ðŸŸ¢ LOW |

---

#### **ABOUT PAGE GAPS**

| Section | Current State | What's Needed | Priority |
|---------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Hero** | Text-only gradient | Craig in vulnerable/authentic moment photo | ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM |
| **The Story** | References non-existent `/craig-vulnerable-moment.jpg` | **BROKEN IMAGE LINK** - needs authentic photo of Craig in boardroom or professional setting | ðŸ”´ CRITICAL |
| **Credentials** | Text-only | Visual timeline or credential showcase with badge integration | ðŸŸ¢ LOW |
| **Values** | Text-only cards | Subtle icon system or abstract visual markers | ðŸŸ¢ LOW |

**CRITICAL BUG:** About page line 58 references `/craig-vulnerable-moment.jpg` which doesn't exist. This creates a broken image. Replace with `craig-headshot.jpg` or `craig-portrait-8372.jpg`.

---

#### **SERVICE PAGES GAPS**

| Service | Current Assets | What's Needed | Priority |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Board Advisory** | iod-conference photos (good) | Client success imagery, boardroom consultation visuals | ðŸŸ¢ LOW |
| **Executive Coaching** | executive-coaching-7490.jpg (good), LIZ photos | One-on-one coaching environment photos | ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM |
| **Pulse Monitoring** | Gemini AI image (BAD) | Dashboard mockup, analytics visualization, or authentic workplace photo | ðŸ”´ CRITICAL |
| **Wellbeing Audit** | None | Audit process imagery, checklist visual, results dashboard | ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM |

---

---

## PART 3: PAGE-BY-PAGE VISUAL STRATEGY

### 3.1 HOMEPAGE VISUAL BLUEPRINT

**Current Performance:** Homepage loads 7.5MB hero image + other unoptimized assets = 15-20MB total page weight

**Target Performance:** Homepage should load <500KB images total on initial viewport

---

#### **HERO SECTION (Current: iod-conference-83.jpg)**

**Visual Goal:** Establish immediate authority and professionalism while maintaining fast load time

**Recommended Treatment:**
```
Background Image Strategy:
1. Mobile (320-767px): 768x432px, WebP, quality 75 = 50-60KB
2. Tablet (768-1023px): 1024x576px, WebP, quality 80 = 80-100KB
3. Desktop (1024-1919px): 1920x1080px, WebP, quality 85 = 180-220KB
4. Retina (1920px+): 3840x2160px, WebP, quality 85 = 350-400KB

Gradient Overlay:
- From gray-900/95 via gray-900/85 to gray-900/60
- Maintains readability while showing professionalism of background

Lazy Loading:
- Above-fold hero loads immediately with loading="eager"
- Preload the mobile/desktop variant appropriate for device
```

**Alternative Approach (Performance Priority):**
Replace full-screen photo background with:
- Solid gradient background (from-gray-900 to-blue-900)
- Craig headshot in circle/rounded container on right side
- Even faster load time, still maintains authority

---

#### **SOCIAL PROOF BAR**

**Current:** Text-only statistics
**Visual Enhancement:**
- Animated counter components (100%, 12, 100+)
- Subtle icon per statistic
- Light gradient background from white to gray-50

**Assets Needed:** None (CSS only)

---

#### **WHY SECTION**

**Current:** Text-only
**Visual Strategy:**
- Three-column icon grid
- Minimal line-art icons (custom or from Lucide icon set)
- Icons: Shield (trust), Target (results), Handshake (partnership)
- Background: White with subtle texture or gradient

**Assets Needed:** 3 SVG icons (15-20KB total)

---

#### **PROBLEM SECTION**

**Current:** Text-only
**Visual Strategy:**
- Before/After split visual
- Left side: Chaotic workplace (can be abstract shapes/lines)
- Right side: Organized, strategic (clean lines/structure)
- Alternative: Simple illustration showing board table with question marks transforming to checkmarks

**Assets Needed:** 1 custom illustration or infographic (50-80KB)

---

#### **MAIN OFFERING SECTION**

**Current:** Service cards with text
**Visual Strategy:**
- Each service card gets subtle gradient background
- Hover effect reveals slightly brighter gradient
- Optional: Small icon per service (30x30px, 5-8KB each)

**Assets Needed:**
- 4 service icons (board, coaching, audit, monitoring) = 20-30KB total

---

#### **METHODOLOGY SECTION**

**Current:** Text-only
**Visual Strategy:**
- Process flowchart: Human Insight â†’ AI Analysis â†’ Strategic Framework â†’ Measurable Results
- Circular or linear flow diagram
- Can be SVG for infinite scaling and small file size

**Assets Needed:** 1 methodology infographic (SVG, 30-50KB)

---

#### **BOARD CTA**

**Current:** Text-only gradient section
**Visual Strategy:**
- Maintain gradient (performs well)
- Optional: Subtle geometric pattern overlay
- Optional: Small icons for each CTA button

**Assets Needed:** None (current design is optimal)

---

### 3.2 ABOUT PAGE VISUAL BLUEPRINT

**Current Crisis:** About page references `/craig-vulnerable-moment.jpg` on line 58, which **does not exist**. This is a broken image that damages user experience.

---

#### **FIX REQUIRED (Line 58):**

**Current (BROKEN):**
```html
<img
  src="/craig-vulnerable-moment.jpg"
  alt="Craig Fearn in a boardroom setting"
  class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

**Replace With:**
```html
<img
  src="/images/craig-headshot.jpg"
  alt="Craig Fearn FCMI FRSPH - Board Advisor & Executive Coach"
  class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  loading="lazy"
  width="800"
  height="1105"
/>
```

**Better Alternative (Optimized):**
After creating optimized versions, use:
```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="/images/craig-headshot-600w.webp"
    type="image/webp"
    media="(max-width: 768px)"
  />
  <source
    srcset="/images/craig-headshot-800w.webp"
    type="image/webp"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/craig-headshot.jpg"
    alt="Craig Fearn FCMI FRSPH - Board Advisor & Executive Coach"
    class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
    loading="lazy"
    width="800"
    height="1105"
  />
</picture>
```

---

**Layout:**
- Text on left (60% width)
- Craig's portrait on right (40% width)
- Mobile: Stack with image first

---

#### **THE STRUGGLE SECTION**

**Visual Elements:**
- Red alert box (currently implemented well)
- Optional: Timeline graphic showing the progression from crisis to solution
- Keep minimal to maintain focus on story

---

#### **CREDENTIALS SECTION**

**Current:** Text-based cards
**Enhancement Options:**
1. Integrate badge images more prominently (IoD, FRSPH, FCMI)
2. Create visual credential timeline
3. Add hover effects that reveal more detail

**Assets Needed:** Timeline SVG illustration (optional, 40-60KB)

---

#### **VALUES SECTION**

**Current:** Text cards with gradient
**Visual Strategy:** Current design is strong. Optional enhancements:
- Subtle icon per value card (governance icon, evidence icon, partnership icon, action icon)
- Keep minimal to maintain professional focus

**Assets Needed:** 4 value icons (20-30KB total, optional)

---

#### **TESTIMONIALS**

**Current:** Text-only blockquotes
**Visual Strategy:**
- Maintain text-only for confidentiality
- Add subtle quotation mark graphic
- Optional: Generic professional silhouette avatars (not photos)

**Assets Needed:** Quotation mark SVG (2-5KB)

---

#### **FINAL CTA**

**Current:** Gradient with white text
**Assessment:** Optimal as-is. No changes needed.

---

### 3.3 SERVICES PAGE VISUAL STRATEGY

#### **Board Advisory Service**

- Add: Subtle icon system for service features

**Assets Needed:**
- Advisory process infographic (50-80KB)
- Feature icons (20-30KB)

---

#### **Executive Coaching Service**

**Current Assets:**
- executive-coaching-7490.jpg (3.1MB) - NEEDS OPTIMIZATION
- 9 LIZ_7481 09.43.39.jpg (3.6MB) - NEEDS OPTIMIZATION
- 18 LIZ_7498.jpg (3.2MB) - NEEDS OPTIMIZATION
- iod-aspiring-badge.png & iod-global-badge.png (optimal)

**Visual Strategy:**
- Hero: Use executive-coaching-7490.jpg optimized as background
- Mid-page: Use LIZ_7481 in content section (optimized to 800w)
- Bottom: Use LIZ_7498 for testimonial/CTA section (optimized to 800w)
- All three photos should be resized to appropriate dimensions

**Critical Optimization:**
```
executive-coaching-7490.jpg (3.1MB) â†’ 200KB (hero background)
9 LIZ_7481 09.43.39.jpg (3.6MB) â†’ 60KB (800px width, content section)
18 LIZ_7498.jpg (3.2MB) â†’ 60KB (800px width, testimonial section)

Total savings: 9.9MB â†’ 320KB (96.8% reduction)
```

---

#### **Pulse Monitoring Service**

**Current Assets:**
- Gemini_Generated_Image_5xdict5xdict5xdi.png (5.4MB) - **DELETE IMMEDIATELY**
- IoD-Ambassador-badge-web.png (optimal)

- Target size: 150-200KB for full-width hero

**Option B: Authentic Workplace Photo**

- Or: Photo of Craig reviewing analytics/reports
- Must show authenticity and professionalism

**Option C: Abstract Data Visualization**
- Clean, minimal graphic showing data flowing into insights
- SVG format for crisp scaling and tiny file size
- Target size: 40-60KB

**Immediate Action:** Delete Gemini image, implement Option A or B within 24-48 hours.

---

#### **Wellbeing Audit Service**

**Current Assets:** None identified in grep results

**Visual Strategy:**
- Hero: Use one of the professional Craig boardroom photos (LIZ series)

**Assets Needed:**
- Hero photo: Use `10 LIZ_7493.jpg` optimized (Craig standing confidently)

---

### 3.4 CONTACT PAGE VISUAL STRATEGY

**Current Assets:**
- craig-headshot.jpg (2.4MB) - NEEDS OPTIMIZATION
- iod-conference-142.jpg (7.5MB) - NEEDS OPTIMIZATION

**Visual Strategy:**
- Top section: Craig headshot (optimized to 400-600px width)
- Background: iod-conference-142.jpg very subtle and blurred as texture
- Focus: Form should be primary visual element

**Optimization:**
```
craig-headshot.jpg (2.4MB) â†’ 40KB (500px width for sidebar)

    width="768"
    height="432"
  />

  <!-- Tablet -->
  <source
    media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
    srcset="/images/hero-1024w.webp"
    type="image/webp"
    width="1024"
    height="576"
  />

  <!-- Desktop -->
  <source
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
    srcset="/images/hero-1920w.webp 1x,
            /images/hero-3840w.webp 2x"
    type="image/webp"
    width="1920"
    height="1080"
  />

  <!-- Fallback for browsers without WebP support -->
  <img
    src="/images/hero-1920w.jpg"
    alt="Craig Fearn at Institute of Directors conference"
    width="1920"

## PART 8: CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED

### 8.1 BROKEN IMAGE LINK (About Page)

**File:** `C:\Users\Fearn\New folder (4)\src\pages\about.astro`
**Line:** 58
**Current Code:**
```html
<img
  src="/craig-vulnerable-moment.jpg"
  alt="Craig Fearn in a boardroom setting"
  class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

**Issue:** File `/craig-vulnerable-moment.jpg` does not exist. This creates a broken image on the About page.

**Immediate Fix (Option 1 - Use Existing Asset):**
```html
<img
  src="/images/craig-headshot.jpg"
  alt="Craig Fearn FCMI FRSPH - Board Advisor & Executive Coach"
  class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  loading="lazy"
  width="800"
  height="1105"
/>
```

**Better Fix (Option 2 - Optimized Asset):**
```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="/images/craig-headshot-600w.webp"
    type="image/webp"
    media="(max-width: 768px)"
  />
  <source
    srcset="/images/craig-headshot-800w.webp"
    type="image/webp"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/craig-headshot.jpg"
    alt="Craig Fearn FCMI FRSPH in professional setting, reflecting on board leadership challenges"
    class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
    loading="lazy"
    width="800"
    height="1105"
  />
</picture>
```

**Action Required:** Choose Option 1 for immediate fix, then upgrade to Option 2 after optimization.

### 8.3 DUPLICATE FILE CLEANUP

**Duplicates Identified:**
```
iod-aspiring-badge.png (34KB) vs iod-aspiring-award-badge.png (34KB)
iod-global-badge.png (34KB) vs iod-global-award-badge.png (34KB)
```

**Action:**
```bash
# Keep the "award" versions (more descriptive names)
# Delete the shorter versions
rm public/images/iod-aspiring-badge.png
rm public/images/iod-global-badge.png

# Update any references in code
# Search for: iod-aspiring-badge.png
# Replace with: iod-aspiring-award-badge.png

# Search for: iod-global-badge.png
# Replace with: iod-global-award-badge.png
```

**Savings:** 68KB (minor but good housekeeping)

### 8.4 FILE NAMING STANDARDIZATION

**Current Issues:**
- Space in filename: `9 LIZ_7481 09.43.39.jpg`
- Inconsistent naming: `10 LIZ_7493.jpg`, `18 LIZ_7498.jpg`
- Non-descriptive: `Global (1).png`

**Recommended Renaming:**
```bash
# Boardroom photos
"10 LIZ_7493.jpg" â†’ "craig-boardroom-standing-7493.jpg"
"18 LIZ_7498.jpg" â†’ "craig-boardroom-seated-7498.jpg"
"9 LIZ_7481 09.43.39.jpg" â†’ "craig-boardroom-professional-7481.jpg"

# Credential badges
"Global (1).png" â†’ "iod-global-finalist-badge.png"

# Conference photos (already well-named)
iod-conference-07.jpg âœ“
iod-conference-142.jpg âœ“
iod-conference-83.jpg âœ“
```

**Rationale:**
- Remove spaces (avoid URL encoding issues)
- Descriptive names (easier to identify in file system)
- Consistent formatting (improved maintainability)
- Preserve original numbers (traceability)

**Action After Optimization:**
When creating optimized versions, use new naming convention from start.

### FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**The current visual strategy is fundamentally sound** - Craig has excellent professional photography assets. The crisis is purely technical: massive file sizes and inappropriate AI imagery.

**Priority 1:** Execute Week 1 optimization immediately. This is a performance emergency that's damaging user experience and business results.

**Priority 2:** Enhance visual storytelling with infographics and icons in Week 2-3.

**Priority 3:** Establish maintenance protocols to prevent future bloat.

Craig's authentic professional photography is a competitive advantage. We must optimize it properly and avoid the temptation of AI-generated imagery that undermines credibility.
