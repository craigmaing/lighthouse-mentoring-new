            "How do we know if our wellbeing strategy is actually working?"
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It was November 2018. I was sitting in the quarterly board meeting of a mid-sized NHS Trust,
            serving as a non-executive director. We'd just finished reviewing our latest wellbeing policy updates,
            staff survey results, and the usual compliance reports.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Then our Chair, Sarah, asked what seemed like a simple question: "Craig, you've been leading
            on our wellbeing governance. How do we actually know if our strategy is working? What's our ROI?"
          </p>
          <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="text-lg text-red-800 font-medium">
              I had policies. I had procedures. I even had a wellbeing committee.
              But I couldn't answer that one critical question.

        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-8">
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            That night, I went home and faced the reality: despite 15 years in healthcare leadership,
            I was treating wellbeing governance like every other director—as a compliance exercise,
            not a strategic opportunity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I had:
          </p>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            <li class="flex items-start">

              No measurable outcomes linking wellbeing to business performance

            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-red-500 font-bold mr-3">×</span>
              No framework for proactive governance vs reactive crisis management

            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-red-500 font-bold mr-3">×</span>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Worse still, I realized I wasn't alone. Every board I'd served on, every director I knew,
            was making the same fundamental mistake.
