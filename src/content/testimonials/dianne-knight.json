  "content": "Craig is the ultimate professional. From start to finish, it is so clear that his aim is how he can help. I would say that over my 5 week course, I had challenges (achievable) yet he stretched me to think further than I would do naturally. Personally, Craig has taught me so much about how I think and how I value what I think. I cannot recommend Craig enough, the most sincere and truly dedicated professional with a passion for developing people mentally. It was a rollercoaster...in a good way, and I cannot thank you enough for making me see more clearly about so many things. Mostly about my self doubt which has held me back for so long.... I am pretty much where I need to be and have the tools to help me get there, thank you so much Craig... your efforts and knowledge are guiding me well and I am excited for my future at work now.",
