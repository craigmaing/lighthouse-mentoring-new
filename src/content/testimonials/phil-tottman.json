  "content": "Craig has had such a profound and positive impact on Book of Beasties, its vision, continued growth and ongoing success. It has been a true pleasure to work with him, learn from him and collaborate on some amazing partnerships and projects. He came into the company with a level on understanding, empathy and guidance that has been unmatched, reinvigorating the mission and the team through his support. He was never one to turn down a challenge, and was always happy to step in to help when we felt out of our depth or overwhelmed and having him part of our journey has made a brilliant experience of starting a business even more so. Beyond his CEO and Chief Advisory positions with Book of Beasties, Craig has become a dear friend and someone that I know can be trusted whole heartedly, something that is a rare quality. It is safe to say that he is an asset to any position he holds, team he joins or project he supports.",
