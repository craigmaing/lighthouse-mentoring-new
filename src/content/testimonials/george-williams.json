He is able to switch from warm and empathetic listener to seasoned entrepreneur in the space of a few minutes, and approaches the subject of organisational wellbeing with depth and balance. Craig is a pleasure to work with and always looks for the value in everything he does - the value for him, the value for his colleagues and the value for his clients. I have no hesitation in recommending him to anyone.",
