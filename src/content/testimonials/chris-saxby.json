  "content": "Craig has led the IoD's activity in Cornwall as a most effective ambassador. He promotes the ideals and values of the Institute and has been incredibly energetic and successful in deriving closer engagement of directors across the SW peninsula. His direct encouragement of learning has supported many of us, me among them. Added to this, Craig's professional focus on wellbeing leadership has also been evident to those attending - not with a salesman's pitch, but through his natural affinity for the subject within his daily approach to all his activities. Craig is someone who leaders find engaging, knowledgeable, and easy to deal with. I can strongly recommend working with him.",
