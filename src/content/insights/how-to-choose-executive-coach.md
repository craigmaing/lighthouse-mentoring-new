The executive who called me last month had already worked with two coaches. Neither engagement had produced the transformation she'd hoped for. As we talked through her experiences, a pattern emerged: she'd selected coaches based primarily on credentials and cost, without clarity about what she actually needed or how to assess whether a particular coach could provide it.

Her story isn't unusual. The coaching marketplace has exploded over the past two decades. More options, yes. But also more confusion. Some coaches hold rigorous credentials from established professional bodies. Others took weekend courses and declared themselves coaches. Some specialize deeply in particular domains. Others are generalists. The variation is enormous.

After seventeen years working with executives and boards, and through my own journey to [EMCC Professional Coach](https://www.emccglobal.org/) qualification, I've learned this: selecting a coach well means balancing multiple things—credentials, experience, chemistry, approach. Get this choice right and you create conditions for meaningful development. Get it wrong and you invest serious time and money without achieving the growth you're after.

## Start With What You Actually Need

Before evaluating coaches, get clear on what you're seeking. Sounds obvious. But many executives start with vague goals: "I want to be a better leader" or "I need help with executive presence." These matter, sure. But they're not specific enough to guide coach selection or enable meaningful progress.

Effective coaching starts with clarity about outcomes. Are you working on specific capabilities—strategic thinking, stakeholder management, decision-making under uncertainty? Navigating a transition—stepping into a bigger role, moving industries, preparing for board-level work? Addressing particular challenges—managing difficult relationships, overcoming imposter syndrome, finding better work-life integration?

The nature of your goals influences which coach serves you best. Someone navigating their first CEO role needs different support than someone developing executive presence. Someone addressing performance challenges benefits from different coaching than someone working on purpose and meaning in their leadership.

Beyond goals, consider your learning style. Do you respond better to challenge or support? Want structured frameworks and tools, or more emergent exploration? Prefer frequent short sessions or less frequent but longer ones? No universally right answer. But knowing your preferences helps you assess fit.

Also consider context. Are you seeking [coaching](/services/executive-coaching) for yourself as an individual leader? Or exploring whether coaching could support your team or organization more broadly? Individual development coaching differs from team or organizational coaching. Many coaches specialize in one domain rather than working across all three.

## Making Sense of Qualifications

The coaching profession has built some pretty robust credentialing systems over the past couple of decades. But navigating them means understanding what different credentials actually mean.

In the UK and Europe, the [European Mentoring and Coaching Council](https://www.emccglobal.org/) runs one of the most rigorous frameworks. It goes from Foundation level through Practitioner and Senior Practitioner up to Master Practitioner.

What do these levels mean? Foundation is introductory training. Practitioner means substantial training, supervised practice hours, and demonstrated competency through assessment. Senior Practitioner or Master Practitioner? Extensive experience, advanced training, sophisticated coaching capability proven through rigorous assessment.

The International Coaching Federation has a parallel system—ACC, PCC, and MCC levels. Requirements differ slightly from EMCC, but the principle's the same: higher levels mean more training, more practice, more rigorous assessment.

Why do credentials matter? Because good coaching isn't just asking questions or offering support. Effective coaches understand adult development theory. They work across multiple system levels—individual, team, organization. They manage the coaching relationship skillfully. They use evidence-based approaches adapted to each client. Professional training and credentialing help ensure coaches have actually developed these capabilities.

That said, credentials aren't everything. A newly credentialed coach with limited life experience might struggle working with senior executives. Meanwhile, someone with decades of board-level experience and slightly lower credentials might serve you brilliantly. The combination matters—credentialing that ensures coaching skill, plus relevant experience that creates quick understanding of the contexts and pressures you face.

Also look for ongoing professional development. The coaching field evolves. Effective coaches maintain learning through supervision, continuing education, engagement with professional communities. A coach who got their credentials ten years ago then stopped developing? Probably not current with best practices.

## Experience That Actually Matters

Many executives assume they need a coach who's walked their exact path. Another ex-CEO. Another board member. Another leader from their industry. Makes sense, right?

Actually, it can be misleading. The coach's value isn't having been in your role. It's their ability to facilitate your thinking about your role.

Some of the most powerful coaching pairs executives with coaches from completely different backgrounds. Why? Because the coach isn't attached to "how it should be done" in that industry or role. They can ask more naïve questions. Often more generative questions. They're less likely to impose their own experience as the template for yours.

That doesn't mean background is irrelevant. Understanding the pressures and dynamics of executive-level work helps coaches grasp context quickly, recognize patterns, ask more informed questions. In my own work with executives, my seventeen years of [board-level experience](/about) across sectors means I understand governance dynamics, board relationships, organizational politics, the particular challenges of leading at senior levels. This enables more sophisticated coaching. But I'm not advising based on my experience—I'm using it to facilitate their thinking.

The distinction is subtle but important. You want a coach whose experience helps them understand your world, but whose primary capability is facilitating development through skilled coaching process rather than advising based on their own career. The balance between these matters more than either alone.

For specialized coaching needs, domain expertise becomes more relevant. Working specifically on wellbeing strategy or governance—increasingly important given board attention to these areas—means a coach with credentials and experience in organizational wellbeing and public health, like an [FRSPH Fellow](https://www.rsph.org.uk/), brings valuable perspective. Developing strategy? Someone with strategic background adds value. But remember: you're seeking coaching, not consulting. The expertise should inform their coaching, not replace it.

## The Chemistry Question

However qualified and experienced a coach might be, if the relationship doesn't feel right, the coaching won't work. This "chemistry" or "fit" thing is crucial. Also difficult to assess before actually working together. That's why most experienced coaches offer discovery sessions—so both parties can assess whether there's enough rapport and trust to support deep coaching work.

What creates good chemistry? Varies by person. But certain indicators signal strong fit. Do you feel heard and understood in initial conversations? Does the coach ask questions that make you think, rather than showing off their knowledge? Do you sense genuine curiosity about you and your challenges, rather than an agenda to deploy their particular methodology?

Pay attention to how comfortable you feel being vulnerable. Effective coaching requires bringing your real challenges into the conversation. Your uncertainties. Your struggles. If you feel you need to present only your polished, confident self, the relationship lacks the safety required for transformative work.

Also assess whether the coach's style matches your needs. Some coaches are challenging—pushing hard on assumptions and inconsistencies. Others are supportive, creating space for exploration. Some work with structured frameworks and tools. Others take a more emergent, conversational approach. None of these is universally better. What matters is the match between the coach's natural style and what'll serve your development.

The chemistry assessment goes both ways. Ethical coaches sometimes decline engagements even when clients want to work with them. They recognize fit isn't strong enough, or another coach might serve better. If a coach seems too eager to take you on without assessing fit carefully? That itself might be concerning.

## Practical Considerations

Beyond qualifications, experience, and chemistry, several practical things influence whether a coaching relationship will work well.

Session format matters more than people realize. Some coaching relationships flourish in person—the coach picks up subtle cues, the physical presence creates a particular quality of attention. Other engagements work brilliantly via video. More flexibility in scheduling. No travel time.

For executive coaching specifically, delivery mode influences what's possible. Some work—particularly around presence, physicality, group dynamics—benefits from being in person. Other areas—strategic thinking, decision-making frameworks, working through complex problems—translate perfectly well to video. Consider what you're working on and which format best serves those goals.

Frequency and session length is another choice. Some coaches work in sixty-minute sessions, others prefer ninety. Some recommend weekly or fortnightly sessions, others monthly. Research suggests more frequent contact (weekly or fortnightly) supports faster development. Monthly sessions enable more time to apply learning between sessions. Your schedule, learning style, and the intensity of what you're working on all influence what frequency serves you.

Duration of engagement matters too. Some coaches prefer open-ended relationships. Others work in defined blocks—often six to twelve months. For executive coaching addressing specific development goals, time-bounded engagements often work well. You can always extend if needed. But having a defined timeframe creates natural points for assessing progress and deciding whether to continue.

The investment level varies enormously. Rates reflect credentials, experience, specialization, market positioning. Higher fees don't always mean better coaching. But very low fees often signal inexperience or coaches building practices without formal credentials. For executive-level coaching, expect to invest meaningfully. This work directly shapes your leadership effectiveness and organizational impact. One of the highest-value professional development investments available.

## Red Flags to Watch For

Certain patterns should give you pause when selecting a coach.

Promises of specific outcomes? Big red flag. Ethical coaches recognize that you do the work of coaching. They facilitate your development, but they can't guarantee particular results. A coach who promises you'll get promoted, resolve specific relationships, or achieve particular goals is either naive about how coaching works or operating unethically.

Lack of credentials or vague claims about training warrant scrutiny. Some people call themselves executive coaches after weekend workshops. Or no formal training at all. Credentials alone don't ensure quality. But their absence should prompt deeper questions about how someone developed their coaching capability and whether they maintain professional standards.

Rigidly prescriptive methodologies can signal limited coaching sophistication. Effective coaches hold multiple frameworks and approaches, adapting to what each client needs. Someone who insists every client must follow their particular method or complete their specific assessment instrument? More interested in deploying their product than serving your development.

Boundary issues appear in various forms. Coaches who want to be your friend. Who share extensively about their own lives and challenges. Who seem overly invested in your decisions. They're not maintaining the professional boundaries that protect the coaching relationship. Similarly, coaches who want to advise you on everything beyond coaching—investments, relationships, business deals—have moved beyond their professional scope.

Finally, watch for coaches who seem threatened by questions about their credentials, experience, or approach. Confident, ethical coaches welcome questions about their background and methodology. They understand selecting a coach is an important decision requiring due diligence. Defensiveness or evasion in response to reasonable questions? Suggests lack of professional maturity.

## Questions to Ask Prospective Coaches

When speaking with potential coaches, certain questions help you assess fit and capability.

Ask about credentials and training: "What coaching qualifications do you hold, and when did you achieve them?" This reveals not just credentials but also whether they're current or dated. "How do you maintain your professional development?" Shows commitment to ongoing learning.

Explore their approach: "How would you describe your coaching philosophy and methodology?" Good coaches can articulate their approach clearly while acknowledging it adapts to individual clients. "Can you walk me through how a typical coaching engagement unfolds?" Helps you understand their process.

Understand their experience: "What's your background working with executives at my level?" and "What types of challenges do you most commonly work with?" This tells you whether they're experienced with the kinds of issues you're facing. "Can you share an example of a coaching engagement that didn't go well and what you learned?" Demonstrates self-awareness and learning from experience.

Address practical matters directly: "What's your fee structure?" "How do you handle scheduling and rescheduling?" "What happens if we start working together and either of us feels the fit isn't working?" These aren't unimportant details. They're the infrastructure that enables coaching work to happen smoothly.

Ask about confidentiality and boundaries: "How do you handle confidentiality?" "Are there circumstances where you'd break confidentiality?" Understanding these principles prevents unpleasant surprises. For coaches working in organizations where you're funded by your employer, ask: "How do you handle the three-way relationship between coach, client, and organization?"

## Supervision and Ethical Practice

Here's a marker of quality coaching most executives don't know to ask about: coaching supervision. This isn't supervision in the managerial sense. It's a professional practice where coaches themselves work with more experienced practitioners to reflect on their coaching work, work through challenges, continue developing their practice.

Professional coaching bodies typically require qualified coaches to engage in regular supervision. The [Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development](https://www.cipd.org/uk/knowledge/factsheets/coaching-mentoring-factsheet/) and EMCC both emphasize supervision as essential to maintaining ethical, high-quality practice. A coach who engages in regular supervision demonstrates commitment to professional standards. Also self-awareness about the need for ongoing support in their practice.

Ethical guidelines matter too. Professional coaches adhere to codes of ethics covering confidentiality, boundaries, conflicts of interest, professional conduct. These aren't just aspirational. They're enforceable standards. A coach should be able to tell you which professional body's ethical code they follow and how they handle common ethical dilemmas.

## The Discovery Process

Most experienced coaches offer some form of discovery session—a conversation to explore whether working together makes sense. Treat this as a two-way evaluation. Yes, you're assessing whether this coach can help you. But the coach is also assessing whether they're well-positioned to serve your needs. This mutual assessment creates a stronger foundation than either party selling to the other.

Come to discovery conversations with clarity about what you're seeking and genuine questions about the coach's approach. But also stay open to how the conversation unfolds. Sometimes the most valuable coaches challenge your assumptions about what you need. Or suggest different ways of framing your goals. This initial experience of being coached, even briefly, often tells you more than any amount of discussion about credentials and experience.

After a discovery conversation, notice your response. Do you feel energized about the possibility of working together? Did the conversation generate new thinking or insight? Could you imagine being candid about your real challenges with this person? Your intuitive response matters alongside rational assessment.

## Making Your Decision

Once you've spoken with several potential coaches, the decision often becomes clearer. One coach typically stands out as the best fit—credentials, experience, approach, chemistry, practical factors all align with your needs. Trust this assessment. But also remain open to surprise. Sometimes the coach you initially thought was perfect doesn't produce strong results. Meanwhile, someone you had more reservations about turns out to be transformative.

Remember you're not trapped in your choice. Most coaching relationships include explicit agreements about how to conclude the engagement if it's not working. After an initial period—three or four sessions—both you and the coach should have enough experience working together to assess whether continuing makes sense.

The goal isn't finding the perfect coach. Doesn't exist. Rather, finding a good-enough match who can facilitate meaningful development. With clear goals, appropriate questions, and honest assessment of fit, you can identify coaching support that'll genuinely serve your leadership development.

If you're exploring whether [executive coaching](/services/executive-coaching) might support your leadership growth, a [discovery conversation](/contact) can help clarify both what you're seeking and whether a particular coaching relationship would serve those goals. The investment in choosing well pays dividends throughout your coaching engagement and beyond. The capabilities you develop continue serving you long after the coaching relationship concludes.
