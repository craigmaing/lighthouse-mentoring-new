If you've spent any time looking for executive development support, you've probably noticed something confusing. Some people call themselves coaches. Others call themselves mentors. Some offer both. And nobody seems to agree on what the difference actually is.

This isn't just semantic hair-splitting. The distinction matters because coaching and mentoring work in fundamentally different ways, serve different purposes, and produce different outcomes. Choose wrong—or work with someone who can't tell the difference—and you'll invest months of time and serious money without getting what you need.

I've spent seventeen years working at board and senior management level, from NHS governance to tech scale-ups. What I've seen is this: the executives who get the most value from development support are the ones who understand what coaching is, what mentoring is, and which one (or sometimes both) they actually need right now.

## Why Everyone's Confused About This

The muddle has historical reasons. Mentoring goes way back—we're talking Homer's Odyssey ancient. Mentor was the advisor to Odysseus's son. For centuries, mentoring meant exactly that: someone experienced sharing what they've learned with someone less experienced.

Executive coaching is much newer. It really took off as a profession in the 1980s and 90s, pulling from sports coaching, psychology, and organizational development. The [Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development](https://www.cipd.org/uk/knowledge/factsheets/coaching-mentoring-factsheet/) tracks this stuff, and they note that coaching as we know it is basically a modern invention.

Here's where it gets messy. As both fields professionalized, the boundaries got fuzzy. Mentoring, which used to be informal (senior person takes junior person under their wing), became structured programs. Coaching, which started focused on performance, expanded into broader development territory. And practitioners started offering both, sometimes without being clear which hat they were wearing when.

## The Core Difference: How They Actually Work

Here's what really separates coaching and mentoring. They're built on different beliefs about how people grow.

Executive coaching starts with this assumption: you already have what you need to solve your problems. You've got the creativity, the resources, the capability. What you need is someone to help you access it. A coach doesn't give you answers. They ask questions that help you find your own answers. They create space for you to think clearly and commit to action.

This comes from humanistic psychology—Carl Rogers and that tradition—which says people are fundamentally capable of figuring things out if you create the right conditions. A qualified coach (someone with credentials from bodies like the [European Mentoring and Coaching Council](https://www.emccglobal.org/)) is trained to create those conditions through skilled questioning, active listening, and structured reflection.

Mentoring works differently. It says: wisdom is transferable. Someone who's been where you're going can save you time, help you avoid mistakes, show you what actually works. A mentor's value is their experience. Where coaching is all questions, mentoring includes advice. Where coaching helps you develop your own thinking, mentoring offers you the benefit of someone else's hard-won lessons.

Neither approach is better. They're different tools. Which one you need depends on what you're trying to do.

## What It Looks Like in Practice

The philosophical difference shows up in how these relationships actually work day-to-day.

[Executive coaching](/services/executive-coaching) is structured. You start with contracting—what are we working on, how will we know if it's working, what are the boundaries. Sessions run to a set length, usually sixty to ninety minutes. There's a framework underneath, whether that's GROW (Goals, Reality, Options, Will) or something more sophisticated.

What you won't get is the coach sharing their own war stories or telling you what to do. They're holding up a mirror. Asking questions that make you notice assumptions you didn't know you had, patterns you hadn't spotted, options you hadn't considered.

Mentoring is looser. Might be coffee rather than a booked session. The mentor explicitly draws on their experience: "When I was Finance Director and faced something similar, here's what I learned." The conversation wanders beyond your immediate development goals into career strategy, how to navigate your organization, building the right relationships.

Duration matters too. Coaching engagements have endpoints—six months, a year, until you achieve specific outcomes. Then you're done. Mentoring relationships can run for years. They often get less formal over time, becoming more collegial. Sometimes evolving into something where both people benefit from the exchange.

## Does the Coach Need to Have Done Your Job?

Here's something most executives get wrong. They assume they need a coach who's walked their exact path. Ex-CEO coaching a CEO. Former CFO coaching a CFO. Makes intuitive sense, right?

But professional coaching doesn't work that way. The value isn't that the coach has been in your shoes. It's that they're really good at the coaching process. A skilled coach can work with executives across industries because they're not giving strategic advice or telling you what worked for them. They're facilitating your thinking. Helping you access your own wisdom. Supporting you to work through your specific challenges.

Now, background isn't irrelevant. When I work with executives and board members, my seventeen years of [board-level experience](/about) helps. I understand the pressures. I recognize the dynamics. I can spot patterns common to board-level leadership. But in a coaching capacity, I'm not offering that as advice. I'm using it to ask better questions and to quickly grasp the context you're operating in.

Mentoring is different. There, relevant experience is the whole point. If you're stepping into your first NED role, a mentor who's served on multiple boards can show you the ropes—board dynamics, governance frameworks, how to add value without overstepping. If you're building a wellbeing strategy, a mentor with [organizational wellbeing](/services/organizational-wellbeing) expertise can share what actually works and what pitfalls to avoid.

So which do you need? If you're facing something where you need to develop your own approach—because your situation is unique, or because developing your own thinking is part of your growth—coaching is powerful. If you're entering new territory where someone else's been-there-done-that experience would save you time, mentoring makes more sense.

## Questions vs. Answers: The Clearest Difference

Want to know the most obvious difference? How much each approach uses questions versus advice.

In coaching, the coach might ask questions for the entire session and give you virtually zero advice. They'll reflect what they're hearing. Summarize patterns. Maybe offer an observation. But they won't tell you what to do.

This can be frustrating at first. Especially if you're action-oriented and used to seeking expert input then making fast decisions. But here's why it works: when you figure something out yourself, you own it. You understand the reasoning. You're committed to the action. And you've built thinking capacity that'll serve you next time.

Mentoring includes questions, but it also gives you answers. A mentor will say, "Here's what I'd do in your position," or "When I dealt with a similar board situation, this approach worked." Their experience becomes a resource you can tap directly.

In practice, lots of good developmental relationships use both approaches. The [Institute of Directors](https://www.iod.com/resources/employment-and-skills/coaching-and-mentoring-for-business-professionals/) notes that board-level professionals often benefit from support that can flex between modes depending on what's needed. Your development partner might be primarily your coach but occasionally shift into mentoring when their specific experience is directly relevant.

This hybrid thing requires skill, though. The practitioner needs to be clear about which mode they're in and why. Otherwise it gets muddy and everyone ends up frustrated.

## The Credentials Question

Coaching has professionalized hard over the past couple of decades. There are now proper credentialing systems. The [European Mentoring and Coaching Council](https://www.emccglobal.org/), for instance, runs from Foundation through Practitioner and Senior Practitioner to Master Practitioner. Each level requires demonstrated competency and supervised practice hours.

This matters because good coaching is sophisticated work. You need to understand adult development. Psychological safety. How to manage the coaching relationship. Evidence-based approaches. Professional coach training typically means hundreds of hours of instruction, supervised practice, and assessed competency.

Mentoring hasn't gone down this route. There are mentor training programs, sure. Some professional bodies offer mentor development. But there's nothing like the EMCC or ICF credentialing for mentoring. Makes sense when you think about it—mentoring grew from informal knowledge transfer. The mentor's experience and willingness to help mattered more than training in process.

What this means for you: when you're choosing a coach, credentials are useful indicators. Ask about training, professional body membership, ongoing development. My EMCC Professional Coach qualification, for example, represents hundreds of hours of training and practice, supervision, and adherence to professional standards. When you're choosing a mentor, their credentials matter less than their relevant experience, their wisdom, and whether they're genuinely willing to invest in your development.

## When Coaching Makes Sense

Some situations really call for coaching rather than mentoring.

When you're facing complex challenges without clear precedents, coaching's focus on developing your thinking is invaluable. You're not looking for what worked for someone else. You need to figure out what'll work for you in your unique context.

Coaching excels when you're building capabilities you'll use again and again. Not getting advice on this quarter's strategy challenge—developing your strategic thinking capacity. Not learning how to handle one difficult board member—developing your broader relationship intelligence.

Many executives find coaching most valuable during transitions. Taking on a bigger role. Moving industries. Facing a major shift in organizational dynamics. These moments need more than new knowledge. They need new ways of thinking about yourself, your impact, your approach to leadership. Coaching creates space for that deeper work.

Coaching is also powerful when questions of authenticity, values, or purpose surface. These aren't areas where someone else's answers help. You need to work out your own stance, your own priorities, your own definition of success. A skilled coach creates the conditions for that exploration—which is often uncomfortable but necessary.

## When Mentoring Makes More Sense

Mentoring becomes valuable when you're entering unfamiliar territory and someone else's experience can save you time and mistakes.

Taking your first board role? A mentor who's served on multiple boards can show you the unwritten rules, help you avoid common pitfalls, explain how governance actually works versus how it's supposed to work. Implementing your first major wellbeing initiative? A mentor with that experience can share what worked, what flopped, what looked good on paper but died in practice.

Mentoring is especially valuable for navigating specific organizational contexts. A mentor inside your organization—or someone who knows your industry intimately—can give you insights about culture, politics, key relationships that an external coach wouldn't know or provide.

Early in your career or when entering new domains, mentoring provides that foundational knowledge transfer. As you get more senior and face increasingly unique challenges, the balance often shifts toward coaching. But even at the highest levels, domain-specific mentoring has value. A new NED can benefit from an experienced NED showing them the ropes, even while they're working with a coach on broader leadership development.

## Why Not Both?

In my work with executives and boards, the most effective support often uses both approaches. Someone facing board performance challenges? We might use pure coaching to develop their thinking about board dynamics and their role. But when we hit specific governance frameworks or wellbeing governance—areas where my [FRSPH Fellowship](https://www.rsph.org.uk/) and board experience are directly relevant—I might shift into sharing what I've seen work.

The key is being explicit. Which mode am I in right now, and why? This clarity ensures we're using the right tool for each particular need. And it helps you develop your own judgment about when you need questions and when you need answers.

This recognizes something important: executive development isn't one-dimensional. Sometimes you need the challenge and reflection coaching provides. Sometimes you need someone else's hard-won experience. Often, you need both—just applied thoughtfully to different aspects of your development.

## How to Choose

If you're considering getting support, start with clarity about what you actually need. Are you facing challenges where you need to develop your own answers? Or situations where learning from someone's experience would save time? Building capabilities you'll use repeatedly? Or navigating specific situations where guidance would help?

Your answers point toward what'll serve you best. And remember—your needs change. You might work with a coach for six months on leadership presence and strategic thinking. Then engage a mentor for navigating a specific board situation. Then return to coaching for the next phase of development.

The confusion between coaching and mentoring is understandable. The fields have evolved and overlapped. But understanding the distinction—both philosophically and practically—helps you seek the support that'll genuinely serve your development. Whether that's coaching, mentoring, or a thoughtful mix of both.

If you're exploring what kind of support might work for you, a [discovery conversation](/contact) can help clarify which approach—or combination—would best serve where you are right now. Getting this choice right pays dividends throughout your leadership journey.
