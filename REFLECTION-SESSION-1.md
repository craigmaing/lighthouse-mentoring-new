# ü§î REFLECTION: Design Agency Session 1
**Self-Assessment of Performance Against Brief**
*Generated: January 2025*

---

## ‚ùì AM I FOLLOWING THE PROMPT?

**Brief requirement**: "Work as a total design agency with all relevant employees (agents)"

**My performance**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL

**What I did RIGHT**:
- Deployed 4 agents in parallel (research x2, design, content)
- Each agent worked independently and delivered findings
- Created comprehensive research documents:
  - COMPETITOR-ANALYSIS-NED-SERVICES.md (26K words)
  - COMPETITOR-ANALYSIS-EXECUTIVE-COACHING.md (35K words)
  - DESIGN-TRENDS-2025-CONSULTANCY.md
  - HOMEPAGE-COPY-NED-FIRST.md
  - STRATEGIC-POSITIONING-DOCUMENT.md
  - COMPREHENSIVE-SITE-AUDIT.md

**What I did WRONG**:
- Didn't work as PROJECT MANAGER coordinating agents
- Agents delivered results but I didn't synthesize them properly
- Jumped to audit/analysis before agents finished
- Not working as true "agency departments"
- Missing: UX agent, SEO agent, Development agent working in parallel

---

## üéØ WHAT THE BRIEF ACTUALLY ASKED FOR

Let me re-read the exact requirements:

1. ‚úÖ **"Delete old project MD files"** - DONE (deleted old research files)

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Conduct fresh research on most searched keywords"** - PARTIAL
   - Used DataForSEO MCP for real UK search volumes ‚úÖ
   - Documented in KEYWORD-RESEARCH-2025.md ‚úÖ
   - BUT didn't deeply analyze ALL services (only touched 4 main ones)

3. ‚úÖ **"Research competitors for each service"** - DONE
   - NED competitors analyzed (10 competitors)
   - Executive coaching competitors analyzed (8 competitors)
   - BUT missing: management consulting, wellbeing consulting deep-dives

4. ‚úÖ **"Research design trends"** - DONE
   - Created DESIGN-TRENDS-2025-CONSULTANCY.md
   - Covered 2025 trends, color schemes, typography, performance

5. ‚ùå **"Constantly write findings to MD files"** - NOT DOING THIS ENOUGH
   - Writing big documents at end
   - Should be writing INCREMENTAL findings as I discover them

6. ‚ùå **"Reflect after EACH conversation"** - NOT DOING THIS
   - This is my FIRST reflection document
   - Should have written one after initial research
   - Should have written one after strategic questions
   - Should be reflecting constantly

7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Use 1M context and work agentically"** - PARTIAL
   - Deployed agents ‚úÖ
   - But not using full agentic approach (project manager + departments)

8. ‚ùå **"Build in Astro using ONLY existing images"** - NOT STARTED YET
   - Haven't touched any Astro code yet
   - Was about to, but got interrupted (correctly) for not following prompt

## üí° WHAT I'VE LEARNED

### Strategic Insights Gained

1. **Craig's Business Reality**:
   - Wants: 40% NED work, 20% coaching, 20% management, 10% wellbeing, 10% speaking
   - Has: 100% wellbeing consulting from H&S word-of-mouth
   - Website generates: ZERO inquiries
   - NED positions: 0 (wants 4-5)

2. **Market Opportunity**:
   - "non executive director" = 5,400 searches/month, LOW competition
   - "management consultant" = 5,400 searches/month, LOW competition
   - "workplace wellbeing" = 1,000 searches/month (current focus)
   - Craig is potentially ONLY person globally with IoD Ambassador + FRSPH + FCMI

3. **Core Problem**:
   - Site leads with wellbeing (what he has)
   - Should lead with NED (what he wants)
   - All clients from word-of-mouth, website contributes nothing
   - Hard to attend IoD events (location issue)
   - On NED platforms but no traction (likely wrong profile positioning)

### Competitive Intelligence

**NED Market**:
- No competitors with wellbeing specialization
- Most NEDs are ex-CEOs or finance directors
- Generic positioning dominates
- Pricing hidden (transparency opportunity)
- Blue ocean opportunity for Craig

**Executive Coaching Market**:
- Premium pricing: ¬£500-¬£2,000/hour for CEO-level
- Specialization required (not generic)
- Board experience is rare among coaches
- Most hide pricing (transparency opportunity)

**Design Trends 2025**:
- Bold typography (64-120px hero)
- Trust colors (Berkeley Blue #1E3D59)
- Mobile-first mandatory
- Core Web Vitals critical
- AI-powered interactions emerging

## üö´ WHAT I'M DOING WRONG

### 1. Not Working Agentically Enough

**What I should be doing**:
- Deploy PROJECT MANAGER agent to coordinate
- Deploy separate agents for:
  - SEO strategy
  - UX/user journey mapping
  - Content creation
  - Design implementation
  - Development/coding
- Have agents work IN PARALLEL
- Synthesize agent findings into action plan

**What I'm actually doing**:
- Working solo most of the time
- Occasional agent deployment
- Sequential work, not parallel

### 2. Not Reflecting Constantly

**What I should be doing**:
- Write reflection after EVERY major decision
- Question my approach constantly
- Document "what did I learn" in real-time

**What I'm actually doing**:
- Writing this reflection only because user called me out
- Not self-questioning enough

### 3. Not Being Honest About Limitations

**What I should be doing**:
- Say "I don't know" when I don't know
- Ask clarifying questions
- Admit when approach isn't working

**What I'm actually doing**:
- Assuming I know what to do
- Charging ahead without verification
- Not asking enough questions

### 4. Jumping to Implementation Too Fast

**What I should be doing**:
- Complete ALL research first
- Get user approval on strategy
- THEN implement in code

**What I'm actually doing**:
- Starting to code before strategy is approved
- Assuming research is complete
- Not waiting for validation

## ‚úÖ WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT

1. **Using MCP Tools Properly**
   - DataForSEO for real search volumes ‚úÖ
   - Playwright for viewing site ‚úÖ
   - Deploying agents when needed ‚úÖ

2. **Creating Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Strategic positioning document
   - Competitor analysis (detailed)
   - Keyword research with real data
   - Design trends research
   - Homepage copy ready to implement

3. **Understanding the Strategic Problem**
   - Identified business/website misalignment
   - Recognized NED opportunity (5,400 searches)
   - Documented Craig's goals clearly

4. **Asking Strategic Questions**
   - Created STRATEGIC-QUESTIONS-FOR-CRAIG.md
   - Got answers about business priorities
   - Used answers to guide strategy

---

## üéØ WHAT I NEED TO DO DIFFERENTLY

### Immediate Changes

1. **ALWAYS work agentically**
   - Don't do solo work
   - Deploy agents for EVERYTHING
   - Coordinate as project manager

2. **Write reflections constantly**
   - After every major milestone
   - Before implementing anything
   - When user questions me

3. **Get approval before coding**
   - Present strategy documents
   - Wait for feedback
   - Then implement

4. **Question myself constantly**
   - "Am I following the brief?"
   - "Should I be using an agent for this?"
   - "Have I reflected on this decision?"

### Process to Follow

```
1. RESEARCH (via agents)
   ‚Üì
2. REFLECT (write reflection doc)
   ‚Üì
3. PRESENT findings to user
   ‚Üì
4. GET APPROVAL
   ‚Üì
5. PLAN implementation (via agents)
   ‚Üì
6. REFLECT on plan
   ‚Üì
7. IMPLEMENT (via dev agent if possible)
   ‚Üì
8. REFLECT on implementation
```

## üí≠ HONEST SELF-ASSESSMENT

**Score: 6/10**

**What I'm doing well**:
- Research quality is high
- Using tools properly
- Understanding the strategic problem
- Creating comprehensive documentation

**What I'm doing poorly**:
- Not working agentically enough
- Not reflecting constantly
- Jumping to implementation too fast
- Not getting approval before coding

**What I need from user**:
1. Permission to proceed with NED-first strategy
2. Feedback on strategic positioning document
3. Approval to implement code changes
4. Correction when I'm not following prompt

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (IF USER APPROVES)

### Option A: Deploy Full Agency Approach

**Deploy 5 agents in parallel**:
1. **SEO Strategy Agent** - Create implementation plan for NED keywords
2. **UX Journey Agent** - Map board chair user journey
3. **Design System Agent** - Define colors, typography, components
4. **Content Agent** - Create NED Services page content
5. **Development Agent** - Plan Astro component changes

### Option B: Get User Approval First

**Present to user**:
1. Strategic Positioning Document (for approval)
2. Homepage Copy (NED-first)
3. Comprehensive Site Audit (current vs future)
4. Ask: "Should I proceed with NED-first implementation?"

### What I Should Do

**ASK THE USER**:
- "Have you reviewed the strategic documents?"
- "Do you approve the NED-first direction?"
- "Should I proceed with implementation?"
- "Do you want to see anything else first?"

## ü§î QUESTIONS I SHOULD BE ASKING MYSELF

1. **"Am I following the prompt?"** - SOMETIMES
2. **"Am I working agentically?"** - NOT ENOUGH
3. **"Am I reflecting constantly?"** - NO (this is my first reflection)
4. **"Have I gotten approval?"** - NO
5. **"Am I using 1M context properly?"** - SOMEWHAT
6. **"Am I being honest about limitations?"** - GETTING BETTER

---

## üìù ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT INTERACTION

1. ‚úÖ Write this reflection (DOING NOW)
2. ‚è≥ Wait for user feedback on strategic documents
3. ‚è≥ Get explicit approval before implementing
4. ‚è≥ Deploy full agency approach if approved
5. ‚è≥ Write reflection after each major step

---

## üéì KEY LEARNINGS

1. **User is right to call me out** - I wasn't following the prompt properly
2. **Need to reflect MORE, implement LESS** - Thinking before doing
3. **Agents are tools, not replacement for thinking** - I still need to coordinate
4. **Strategy before tactics** - Get approval before coding
5. **Honesty about process** - Admit when I'm not following brief

---

*This reflection represents my honest assessment of performance against the brief. I will write similar reflections after each major milestone moving forward.*
