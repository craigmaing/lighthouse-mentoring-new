## 6. METHODOLOGY & APPROACH

### Section Headline
**"Experience-Led Insight, Enhanced by Modern Tools"**

### Opening Statement (120 words)
17 years of boardroom pattern recognition—across sectors, through crises, during transformations—creates a database most consultants don't have.

I've seen what actually works when boards face psychosocial risk, not just what compliance frameworks recommend. I've watched organizations recover from critical incidents, navigate crisis, and emerge stronger.

This experience now benefits from AI-enhanced analysis: processing organizational data at scale, identifying patterns humans miss, surfacing early-warning signals before they become crises.

But the counsel remains human. No platforms. No dashboards you're left to interpret. Just strategic insight when you need it, grounded in both proven frameworks and emerging patterns.

### What I Bring to Your Board (Visual: 4 columns)

#### Independent Oversight
Constructive challenge alongside support. No vested interest in maintaining status quo or pushing specific solutions. Your board's strategic success is the only metric.

#### Governance Expertise
IoD Ambassador access to best practice frameworks, regulatory insight, and 20,000+ director network. Governance grounded in practical application, not theoretical compliance.

#### Wellbeing Risk Assessment
Specialized FRSPH capability to identify psychosocial risks before they create performance problems, reputation damage, or regulatory exposure. Unique among NEDs.

#### Crisis Experience
Guided boards through critical incidents, reputation crises, and organizational trauma. Know what works under pressure, not just in strategy documents.

## 7. WHY CRAIG FEARN SECTION

### Section Headline
**"Credentials That Create Competitive Advantage"**

### Unique Value Statement (150 words)
This combination of credentials is potentially unique globally:

**IoD Ambassador** status provides direct access to the UK's premier directors' network, governance resources, and regulatory insight. Only 100 Ambassadors across the UK.

**FCMI Fellow** recognition demonstrates proven strategic management excellence—not just capability, but documented results across organizational transformation, leadership development, and performance optimization.

**FRSPH Fellow** expertise brings specialized public health and wellbeing governance knowledge—increasingly critical as boards face ESG scrutiny, regulatory requirements (ISO 45003), and psychosocial risk exposure.

**17 years** of multi-sector board and executive experience—not theoretical knowledge but practical pattern recognition from navigating real governance challenges, crises, and transformations.

Most NEDs bring two of these. Very few bring three. The fourth—wellbeing governance—is what differentiates board capability in 2025 and beyond.

### What Boards Value (5 key points)

1. **Independent Perspective**
   Challenge grounded in support. I'm there to help you succeed, not to promote my own agenda or defend my recommendations regardless of changing circumstances.

2. **IoD Network Access**
   Direct connection to 20,000+ directors, best practice resources, regulatory updates, and governance frameworks. Your board benefits from collective wisdom of UK's premier directors' organization.

3. **Wellbeing Governance Expertise**
   Specialized capability in fastest-growing board risk area. Understand psychosocial risk assessment, ISO 45003 compliance, ESG reporting, and duty of care obligations—unique among NEDs.

4. **Crisis Experience**
   Guided organizations through critical incidents, reputation crises, organizational trauma. Know what works under pressure, not just what policy documents recommend.

5. **No Conflicts of Interest**
   Don't sell software platforms, implementation services, or ongoing consulting. My only interest is your board's strategic success and governance excellence.

## 14. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### About NED Appointments

**Q: What's the typical time commitment for a NED position?**
A: 12-16 days per year for most appointments, including 4 quarterly board meetings (full day), 2 strategy days, committee meetings, and preparation time. More intensive during crises or major strategic decisions. Less time than executive roles but requires full attention when engaged.

**Q: What's the difference between NED and advisory board member?**
A: NEDs have legal duties under Companies Act—fiduciary responsibilities to the company and shareholders. Advisory board members provide strategic counsel without statutory duties. NEDs are more formal, advisory roles more flexible. Both valuable depending on organizational needs and stage.

**Q: Do you serve on competitor boards?**
A: No. Board appointments require undivided loyalty. I don't accept NED positions with organizations in direct competition. Sector experience benefits your board, but never at the expense of confidentiality or conflicts of interest.

**Q: How many board positions do you typically hold?**
A: Currently seeking 2-3 additional positions to reach 4-5 total NED appointments. This ensures I can give each board genuine attention while maintaining the diverse sector perspective that creates value. Quality over quantity.

**Q: What industries do you have board experience in?**
A: 17 years across healthcare, financial services, technology, professional services, manufacturing, public sector, third sector, and education. Multi-sector experience creates pattern recognition—seeing what works in one industry often provides insight for another.

---

### About Wellbeing Governance Expertise

**Q: Why is wellbeing governance relevant at board level?**
A: Three reasons: (1) Psychosocial risk is now regulated under ISO 45003 and HSE enforcement—boards have duty of care obligations; (2) ESG reporting requires credible wellbeing metrics—investors and procurement require evidence; (3) Strategic impact—employee wellbeing affects retention, performance, reputation, and competitive advantage. No longer just HR's problem.

**Q: What's your approach to wellbeing governance different from HR consultants?**
A: HR consultants focus on policies, programs, and compliance. Board governance focuses on risk oversight, strategic direction, and accountability. I help boards understand their duty of care exposure, integrate wellbeing into strategy, and govern wellbeing as business metric—not delegate it entirely to HR.

**Q: Do you implement wellbeing programs or just provide oversight?**
A: As NED, governance oversight and strategic counsel only. I don't implement programs—that's management's job. As consultant, I can support implementation, but board advisory is about ensuring management has the right strategy, resources, and accountability frameworks.

---

### About Credentials & Expertise

**Q: What does IoD Ambassador actually mean?**
A: Institute of Directors Ambassadors are selected representatives across the UK, chosen to support local members, facilitate networking, and represent IoD values. Only 100 across the country. Provides access to IoD resources, research, governance frameworks, and 20,000+ director network. Credibility signal that IoD trusts my judgment and expertise.

**Q: Why are FCMI and FRSPH Fellows relevant to board service?**
A: Fellow status (vs Member or Chartered) requires demonstrated excellence and peer recognition, not just qualifications. FCMI Fellow proves strategic management capability—organizational transformation, leadership development, performance optimization. FRSPH Fellow proves public health and wellbeing expertise—risk assessment, evidence-based strategy, governance frameworks. Together: strategic capability + specialized expertise.

**Q: How does AI enhance your board contribution?**
A: AI processes organizational data at scale—thousands of survey responses, performance metrics, patterns across time. Identifies signals humans miss and surfaces early warnings. But AI doesn't provide strategic counsel or understand context. I use AI for analysis depth, but board advice remains human judgment grounded in pattern recognition from 17 years experience.

---

### About Investment & Engagement

**Q: What's typical NED compensation?**
A: £20,000-£50,000 annual retainer depending on organization size, time commitment, and committee responsibilities. SME and charity boards typically £20K-£30K. Mid-market companies £30K-£40K. Larger organizations £40K-£50K+. Payment usually quarterly. Transparent and aligned with market rates for experienced NEDs with specialized expertise.

**Q: How long are typical NED appointments?**
A: Initial term usually 2-3 years, renewable subject to performance and board needs. Provides stability for organization while allowing periodic assessment. Some boards prefer 1-year initial term with expectation of renewal. Flexible based on board governance preferences.

**Q: Can we engage you for project-based board advisory before committing to NED appointment?**
A: Yes. Many boards start with board effectiveness review, wellbeing governance assessment, or strategic advisory project to establish trust and see working style. Natural progression to ongoing NED or advisory role if value is clear. Lower risk way to test fit.

**Q: Do you provide references from other boards?**
A: Yes, with permission from those boards. Some prefer anonymity due to confidentiality, but all happy to provide confidential references for serious inquiries. IoD can also verify my Ambassador status and standing.
