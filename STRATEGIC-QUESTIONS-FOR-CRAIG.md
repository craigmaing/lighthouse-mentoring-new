## MY RECOMMENDATIONS PENDING YOUR ANSWERS

**Based on keyword data alone, I'd suggest:**

### OPTION A: NED-FIRST POSITIONING
- Lead with "Non Executive Director Services" (5,400 searches)
- Secondary: Board advisory and governance
- Tertiary: Executive coaching
- Niche: Wellbeing governance expertise as differentiator

**Rationale:** Massive search volume, recurring revenue, plays to IoD Ambassador status

### OPTION B: MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT POSITIONING
- Lead with "Chartered Management Consultant" (FCMI Fellow)
- Secondary: Strategic transformation and change
- Tertiary: Board advisory and coaching
- Niche: Wellbeing-informed management

**Rationale:** Matches search volume (5,400), broader market, less niche

### OPTION C: WELLBEING SPECIALIST (Current)
- Lead with workplace wellbeing governance (1,000 searches)
- Secondary: Board advisory on wellbeing matters
- Niche: Only IoD Ambassador focused on wellbeing

**Rationale:** True differentiation, less competition, but smaller market

### OPTION D: PORTFOLIO PROFESSIONAL
- Equal positioning across all services
- Let clients choose what they need
- Renaissance professional with multiple capabilities

**Rationale:** Reflects reality, maximum flexibility, but may confuse market

---

## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

**Please answer:**
1. Questions 1-4 (critical priorities)
2. Question 6 (AI positioning)
3. Question 10 (what's working/not working)

**Then I can:**
- Create targeted competitor analysis
- Develop positioning strategy
- Design user journeys for YOUR priority audience
- Create content that attracts YOUR ideal client
- Optimize for keywords that matter to YOUR business

---

## MY CURRENT ASSESSMENT

**What your site does REALLY well:**
- Professional, credible design
- Clear credential display
- Personal, authentic tone
- Strong hero message
- Good CTAs

**What could be refined:**
- Audience clarity (who should read this?)
- Service priority (what should they buy first?)
- Management consulting expertise (FCMI is buried)
- NED opportunity (5,400 searches but not prominent)
- Proof points (case studies, results, numbers)

**But I can't refine without knowing YOUR priorities.**

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **You answer the strategic questions above**
2. **I create refined strategy based on your answers**
3. **I implement changes aligned with your business goals**

Because a website isn't about best practices or search volume.

It's about attracting the clients YOU want to serve,
doing the work YOU want to do,
at the rates YOU deserve,
with the lifestyle YOU value.

Let's figure that out first, then build around it.

*This isn't about making your site look better. It's about making your business work better. And that starts with strategic clarity.*
