- **Year 2**: £700,000 revenue (40% board advisory, 20% consulting, 20% coaching, 10% wellbeing)
- **Year 3**: £900,000 revenue (optimal mix achieved, 4-5 board positions)

## STRATEGIC RATIONALE (2 Pages)

### Market Opportunity

**Total Monthly Buyer Searches: 12,130**

| Service | Pure Buyer Volume | Competition | CPC Value |
|---------|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Management Consulting | 2,900/month | LOW | £10.50 avg |
| Business Coaching | 5,700/month | MEDIUM | £9.20 avg |
| Executive Coaching | 2,200/month | LOW-MEDIUM | £10.20 avg |
| Wellbeing Consulting | 1,000/month | LOW | £19.50 avg |

**Critical Discovery**: "Non executive director" (5,400/mo) is 95% job seekers. "Board advisor" (170/mo) captures actual buyers.

### Competitive Gaps We Exploit

**1. Wellbeing Governance Vacuum**
- NO competitors position wellbeing expertise as board-level value
- Post-pandemic boards need psychosocial risk oversight
- ESG requirements expanding to employee wellbeing metrics
- Craig's FRSPH + IoD combination is globally unique

**2. Direct Service Model**
- 70% of market dominated by recruitment intermediaries charging 20-33% fees
- Craig offers direct board advisory without recruitment markup
- Builds long-term relationships vs transactional placements

**3. Integrated Service Journey**
- Competitors offer siloed services
- Craig provides: Wellbeing Audit → Strategic Advisory → Board Position
- Natural progression creates 3x revenue per client relationship

### Craig's Unique Credentials Advantage

**The Triple Crown Nobody Else Has:**

1. **IoD Ambassador**: Selected representative, governance authority (1 of ~50 in UK)
2. **FRSPH Fellow**: Royal Society public health expertise (wellbeing governance)
3. **FCMI Fellow**: Chartered Management Institute strategic leadership

**Market Positioning**: "The only professional globally combining board governance (IoD), public health (FRSPH), and management excellence (FCMI) for organizations recognizing wellbeing as competitive advantage."

### Service Hierarchy Decision

**Strategic Stack** (Based on search intent + Craig's energy):

1. **Management Consulting** (Primary lead generation - 2,900 searches)
2. **Board Advisory** (Premium positioning - 330 searches but £10.21 CPC)
3. **Executive Coaching** (High demand - 2,200 searches)
4. **Wellbeing Governance** (Differentiator, not primary - repositioned from audit to strategy)

5. **Create service-specific lead magnets** - Capture at different intent stages

**MUST AVOID**:
1. **Don't chase "non executive director" keyword** - 95% job seekers
2. **Don't hide pricing** - Transparency builds trust
3. **Don't lead with wellbeing** - It's differentiator, not primary
4. **Don't use generic stock photos** - Invest in professional photography
5. **Don't wait for perfect** - Launch MVP and iterate
